<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Very</span> many of the following pages were written in
the trenches and dug-outs of Greece and Serbia.
I added a chapter or two in Port Said, Alexandria
and Marseilles. That is to say, I wrote far away
from books and without reference to documents, and I
wrote to refresh a mind dulled by the conditions of Active
Service in the Near East. A few chapters were written
in London and a few in Winchester.</p>

<p>Here and there may be found factual inaccuracies,
though if these exist I am not aware of them. But
the spirit of the book is as near the truth as I can
bring it.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">It</span> was when I was a very young man indeed that I
caught and succumbed to my first attack of Shaw-fever.
I do not remember how I caught it; something
in the Manchester air, no doubt, was responsible for
my malady, for a handful of “intellectual” Manchester
people had most daringly produced a complete Shaw play,
and, though I had not witnessed the play, I had read
it, and it was with delight that I saw <cite>The Manchester
Guardian</cite> saying about <cite>You Never Can Tell</cite> just the very
things I had myself already thought. I found that in my
suburban circle of friends I was regarded as harbouring
“advanced” ideas. Shaw, I was told, was “dangerous.”
This bucked me up enormously, and I thereupon wrote a
long essay on Ibsen’s <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> and, desiring further
to astonish and bewilder my friends, got into communication
with Bernard Shaw with a view to having the
essay published in pamphlet form. When it was known in
Manchester suburbia that Shaw had written to me, a boy
still at school, my friends could not decide whether I was
cleverer than they had hitherto supposed or Mr Bernard
Shaw more foolish than seemed possible.</p>

<p>I have never completely recovered from that first
attack of Shaw-fever; like ague, it sleeps in my bones
and, from time to time, makes its presence known by
little convulsions that are disturbing enough while they
last, but which generally die pretty quickly.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of 1901 that I wrote to Mr Shaw
about the particular brand of socialism from which at
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that time I was suffering. It must have been a very raw
and crude brand, and my letter to Bernard Shaw must
have amused him considerably. Certainly his reply was
most diverting. Here it is:</p>

<p class="extraspace">“By all means give ‘every penny you can spare to
those who are most in need of monetary help.’ If you
will be kind enough to send it to the Treasurer of the
Fabian Society, 3 Clement’s Inn, London, W.C., you may
depend upon its being wanted and well used. If you prefer
relieving needy persons, I can give you the names and
addresses of several fathers of families who can be depended
on to absorb all your superfluous resources, however
vast they may be. By making yourself poor for
their sakes you will have the satisfaction of adding one
more poor family to the existing mass of poverty and contributing
your utmost to the ransom which perpetuates
the existing social system. You will go through life consoled
by an inexhaustible sense of moral superiority to
bishops and other inconsistent Christians. And you will
never be at a loss for friends. Where the carcass is there
will the eagles be gathered.</p>

<p>“A world of beggars and almsgivers—beautiful
Christian ideal.</p>

<p>“You are not a prig—only a damned fool. A month’s
experience will cure you.”</p>
<!-- end blockquote -->

<p class="extraspace">But though I think this letter amusing now, I am convinced
I did not think so at the time I received it. I know
not in what terms of pained surprise and hurt vanity I
replied to it, but a few days later I received the following
short <span class="nw">note:—</span></p>

<!-- blockquote -->
<p class="extraspace">“Yes: you are an ass; and nothing will help you until
you get over that.</p>

<p>“‘A has money, B is without. If A doesn’t share with

 </span></span></a>B he is—well, I call him a thief.’ Just what an ass would
do. Pray what do you call B if he accepts A’s bounty?</p>

<p>“I strongly recommend you to become a stockbroker.
You believe that doing good means giving money; and
you fancy yourself in the character of Lord Bountiful
with a touch of St Francis.</p>

<p>“Yes, a hopeless ass. No matter; embrace your
destiny and become a philanthropist. It is not a bad life
for people who are built that way.”</p>
<!-- end blockquote -->

<p class="extraspace">That, I think, most effectively closed the correspondence,
as, I have little doubt, it was intended to do.</p>

<p>During the next few months, having approached Messrs
Greening &amp; Co., the publishers, I was commissioned by
them to write a book on Mr Hall Caine for their <cite>Eminent
Writers of To-day</cite> series. The book being completed and
published before the end of the year, I conceived the idea
of writing another about Mr Bernard Shaw, and communicated
with the dramatist, informing him of my intention
and asking him if he would provide me with
biographical details. This he consented to do, and on
19th December 1901 wrote to me from Piccard’s Cottage,
Guildford, saying: “If you will let me know when you
are coming to London, I will make an appointment with
pleasure and give you what help I can.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later I went to Guildford, but I went there
with a guilty secret hidden in my breast. The secret was
this. My publishers did not care about issuing a complete
book devoted to Bernard Shaw and all his works. I
gathered, much to my amazement, that they did not think
him of sufficient importance. The astounding idea was
then suggested that half my book should be concerned
with Bernard Shaw and the other half with Mr George
Moore. Now, at the time of my visit to Guildford, I had
not imparted this information to Mr Shaw. I did not
anticipate that he would like the suggestion and I thought
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it wiser to disclose it to him by word of mouth rather than
by letter.</p>

<p>I came upon Mr Shaw taking photographs in the little
front garden of Piccard’s Cottage. It was a winter’s day
and an inch of snow lay upon the ground; yet he wore no
overcoat. He insisted upon taking my photograph. He
took me sitting. He took me standing. And when he
had grown tired of playing with his new toy, he suggested
that we should go into the house.</p>

<p>There a hideous surprise awaited me. Lying upon the
sofa of the study was an open copy of the current week’s
<cite>Candid Friend</cite>, a most brilliant and most ruthless paper
edited by Mr Frank Harris.</p>

<p>“There is something there,” said Shaw, nodding in the
direction of the sofa, “that should interest you, I think.”</p>

<p>I sat down, took up the paper and looked at the open
pages. To my horror I saw a most brutal, murderously
clever full-page caricature of Mr Hall Caine on one side,
and on the other a long and most hostile review of my
stupid little book on the famous novelist.... Shaw,
tall and erect, stood looking at me a little malignantly,
and, on the instant, I was on my guard.</p>

<p>I read the review word by word and examined the caricature
very closely. The article was amazingly good,
but, as I read it, I did so wish it had been written about a
book by somebody else. Frank Harris himself, I think,
had written the article and Frank Richardson had drawn
the caricature. I looked up at Shaw and smiled.</p>

<p>“Awfully good, don’t you think?” I said.</p>

<p>He nodded, and by his manner seemed to express
approval of the way in which I had come through the
ordeal. He showed me some photographs he had taken—not
very good photographs. One, taken by his wife, I
think, showed Bernard Shaw with his arm round a female
scarecrow; leaning slightly forward, he was leering at it
with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p><a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>During lunch Shaw devoured a large number of vegetarian
dishes and drank water, whilst Mrs Shaw and I ate
meat and drank wine. It was, I think, the mellowing
influence of a basin of raisins that loosed his tongue and
set him talking without cessation. He spoke of Karl
Marx and Granville Barker, of Mrs Annie Besant and
Janet Achurch, of Mr Sidney Webb and the Fabian
Society, of Morocco and Ancoats, of Shorthand and
Wagner, of <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite> and H. G. Wells ...
in a word, of Shakespeare and the musical glasses.</p>

<p>I rather gathered that he had “got over” Karl Marx
years ago, and I inferred that he considered the work of
this writer indispensable for young cubs to sharpen their
teeth upon, but that he was by no means the last word in
socialism. I think he thought that Bernard Shaw was
the last word. For Granville Barker he had even then a
great regard, and, speaking of him, he offered me some
cider, a bottle of which Barker had drunk some days
previously; as he offered the cider he said that Barker
had “ridden over”—whence, I know not—on his bicycle
and that the cider had made him half tipsy.... The
thought of Mrs Annie Besant appeared to afford him vast
amusement, but he spoke in terms of high regard of Janet
Achurch.</p>

<p>“But she uses her voice wrongly. It is quite the finest
voice on the stage and, perhaps because she knows it is so
fine, she is always trying experiments with it. For a
Shakespeare passage, for example, she will plan out what
I may call a scheme of sound; sound that will rise and fall
with the passion and decline of the words, that will intensify
and grow dim as the mood waxes and wanes. But
the scheme, the design—for it <em>is</em> a kind of design—is
nearly always too elaborate, too involved. It is full of
detail, and the detail is apt to become more prominent
than the general outline. She will start off most magnificently,
lose herself a little, recover herself, lose herself
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>again, and then abruptly strike a woefully wrong note.
Perhaps her ear is wrong; perhaps excitement betrays
her. But, with all her faults—and even her faults are
more interesting than other people’s excellencies—she
remains a superb actress.”</p>

<p>Of Mr Sidney Webb I remember nothing that he said,
nor have any of the loving words he spoke of the Fabian
Society remained in my memory. He spoke of it a great
deal, both at lunch and during our subsequent walk, but
somehow or other the Fabian Society has always seemed
to me a bloodless and dull sort of institution, and while he
talked about it my thoughts wandered, and I mused rather
sadly over the psychology of this man whose moral
earnestness was so much greater than my own.</p>

<p>But I pricked up my ears when the word “Morocco”
fell from his lips, though in the event he said very little
about it. I found he had no great belief in the value of
travel as a means of education, an expander of the mind.
He himself had never travelled; places and countries so
precisely fulfilled all your expectations that, really, what
was the use of going to see them? Facts, people and
ideas: nothing else aroused his curiosity.</p>

<p>Of shorthand he said ... well, you don’t particularly
want to know what he said of shorthand, do you? And
in <cite>The Perfect Wagnerite</cite> he has said all that it is necessary
for him to say about Wagner. Last of all comes H. G.
Wells.</p>

<p>Now, I have not the remotest idea what Shaw thinks of
Wells in these days, yet I would give a good deal to know.
But sixteen years ago the older man had for the younger
an almost reverential admiration. At the time of my
visit to Shaw one of Wells’ books was appearing serially in,
I think, <cite>The Fortnightly Review</cite>. Wells was busy looking
into the future, and the future that he saw seemed, in
some respects, so disagreeable yet so likely that Shaw
was dismayed at the prospect.
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“A great man, Wells,” said Shaw; “do you know
anything about him?”</p>

<p>I told him the little I knew and, as we had finished
lunch, I asked Mrs Shaw’s permission to light a
cigarette.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after, we started on our walk.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget that terrible walk. I believed then,
as I believe now, that Shaw was deliberately pitting his
powers of endurance against my own—the powers of endurance
of a middle-aged vegetarian against those of a
young meat-eater. He walked with a long, easy stride,
swinging his arms, breathing deeply through his wide
nostrils. His pace, which never for a moment did he
attempt to accommodate to mine, was at least five miles
an hour. He forgot, or he did not choose to remember,
that I had that morning travelled by the slow midnight
train from Manchester, that I had crossed London, that I
had reached Guildford by a weary Sunday train from
Waterloo, and that I had just eaten an enormous lunch.
I panted and struggled half a pace behind him. I became
stupendously hot. I made unexpected and unathletic
sounds, like a man who is being smothered. Blissfully
unconscious of all this was Shaw.... I wonder?...
No; blissfully conscious of all this was Shaw.</p>

<p>He talked steadily the whole time, but I was suffering
from an inhibition of all my mental faculties. Yet, at the
back of my mind, I kept saying to myself: “You know,
you have not yet told him that he is to share your book
with George Moore.” And each time I told myself that,
I shuddered somewhat.</p>

<p>It was not until we had neared Mr G. F. Watts’ house
that Shaw moderated his pace a little.</p>

<p>“That,” said he, in a curiously low voice—the kind of
voice one uses in churches—“that is where G. F. Watts
lives.”</p>

<p>And he pointed to some high chimneys that overtopped
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>a belt of trees, and stopped and gazed. But I was in no
mood of reverence and, though I have frequently struggled
to induce a feeling of rapture when gazing upon the large
canvases of Watts, I have never been able to do so. So
I pulled out my handkerchief and wiped my perspiring
forehead.</p>

<p>“Hot?” asked Shaw grimly.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m hot. Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Warm. Just nicely warm.”</p>

<p>Presently we came to a tall tower of terra-cotta bricks
which, Shaw told me, had been erected by the villagers
under the direction and at the instigation of Watts himself.
We stopped in front of this and, as it was one of the
“sights” of the district, I felt that I was expected to say
something wise or, at all events, something complimentary
about it. I could say neither.</p>

<p>“Which do people imagine it to be—useful or ornamental?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said he.</p>

<p>“For it is neither,” I ventured.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were otherwhere, for he began a long,
technical exposition on the art of making bricks and tiles.
His talk became art-and-crafty. I was carried back to
my childhood days, my kindergarten days. I heard the
name of William Morris and I sighed most profoundly.</p>

<p>Shaw won that walk by a neck. Having reached
Piccard’s Cottage, he put me in a kind of conservatory,
gave me a blanket and a deck chair and told me to go
to sleep. But already I <em>was</em> <span class="nw">asleep....</span></p>

<p>When I awoke it was quite dark, and, feeling rather
miserable, I groped my way back to the house. There I
found Mr and Mrs Shaw in the study, she frowning at her
desk, he standing on the hearthrug and looking at her
most quizzically.</p>

<p>“Well, how much is it?” she asked. “Four times
into two hundred. The cheque <em>must</em> go by to-night’s
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>post. I’ve done the sum three times, and on each occasion
I’ve got a different answer.”</p>

<p>“Is it two hundred pence or two hundred pounds?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd, George. Even you know that you
can’t get a furnished house like this for two hundred pence
a year.”</p>

<p>“Four times into two hundred—let me see—fifty.
Yes, fifty. You can safely write down fifty pounds.”</p>

<p>That little incident safely over, we turned to tea.</p>

<p>I induced Shaw to talk about his own work, and I
quickly discovered that, unlike most authors, he had no
feeling of bitterness that he had had to spend years in hard
work before he won public recognition.</p>

<p>“A writer of originality must expect to have to wait.
If a writer is acclaimed immediately—I mean a writer on
social and artistic subjects—he may be pretty sure that
he is saying things that have been said before. He may
be saying them better than anybody else; nevertheless,
they are the same things. My own success has been
gained, and is very largely maintained, by the force of
my personality and by the tradition about myself that
has gradually grown up in the mind of the public. For
example, if I were to write an article and give it to you to
copy out and offer to editors in your own name, you being
the professional author, I doubt very much if a single
editor would look at it twice. A good deal, you see, <em>is</em> in
a name.”</p>

<p>It was when Mrs Shaw, having sipped her tea, had left
the room, that I broached the subject of my book.</p>

<p>“Publishers are curious people,” I remarked meditatively.</p>

<p>He sat silent.</p>

<p>“My own publishers in particular. They are now
fighting shy of a book solely about you.”</p>

<p>I paused and glanced at him. But he was gazing at me
with eyes of a mild malice and he was very silent.</p>

<p><a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Yes,” I continued. “To put it bluntly, they think
that a book solely about you would not be a success. So
that they propose the first half of the book should be
concerned with you and the second half with George
Moore.”</p>

<p>“And the title?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Why? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think <cite>The Two Mad Irishmen</cite> would
go rather well?”</p>

<p>I floundered. If he was going to be witty or sarcastic,
or anything horrid of that kind, I should be nowhere at
all. To cover my confusion—and, as it chanced, to make
that confusion worse—I began to talk very rapidly.</p>

<p>“I know their suggestion is awfully stupid, but then
publishers do make stupid suggestions. That, I suppose,
is why they are so successful. Of course, George Moore
and <span class="nw">yourself——”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, George has worked awfully hard,” said Shaw
reasonably. “I don’t suppose there is a more conscientious
artist living. He has dug out of himself everything
there was to be got. No one could have tried more. As
a worker, George is magnificent. But, really, when you
suggest a <span class="nw">book——”</span></p>

<p>“No! No! I don’t suggest it for one moment,” I
interrupted.</p>

<p>“Then what are we discussing?”</p>

<p>“Well, in the first instance, my publishers <span class="nw">suggested——”</span></p>

<p>“Ha! ‘In the first instance!’ No; it really cannot
be done. If you wish to write the book nobody, of
course, can stop you, but if you do you must not expect
me to countenance it. I shall wash my hands of the
whole business.”</p>

<p>And, in spite of some further conversation, that remained
his unshakable attitude.</p>

<p>An hour later he walked with me down to the station,
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I resolving all the way that I would persuade my publisher
to accept two books. Shaw droned on about Sidney Webb
and the Fabian Society.... So many people have
talked to me of Sidney Webb. I wonder why. I have
heard Sidney Webb speak; he knows all about figures
and dates and money and wages, and so on.... But of
human nature he knows nothing; he knows less than a
child, for a child has at least intuition. Figures don’t go
very far, do they? Of course, by manipulation, you can
make them go all the <span class="nw">way....</span></p>

<p>But, as I was saying, Shaw talked about Fabianism and
Webbism all the way to the station.</p>

<p>He was good enough to wait till the train started, and
the last I saw of him as I leant through the window was a
long, lean figure standing under a lamp. The figure wore
no overcoat, but I noticed, even when a hundred yards
separated us, a pair of thick, home-knitted woollen
<span class="nw">gloves....</span></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—The book was never written, for my publishers
could not be persuaded to take G.B.S. at his own or my
estimate.</p>

<p>Mr George Moore, on being approached, wrote me from
Dublin, saying, inconsequently enough, that he had never
asked anybody to write about him nor had he ever asked
anybody to refrain from doing so. On the whole, he
thought it better that if A (myself) wished to write about
B (Mr George Moore), it would be an excellent arrangement,
provided that:</p>

<p>(1) A was an intimate friend of B’s, or</p>

<p>(2) A was a complete stranger to B.</p>

<p>I was left, most courteously, to infer that I (A), being a
complete stranger, had better remain so.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>I have done.</p>

 />MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<p class="chapcontents"><small>Mrs Annie Besant—Marcus Stone—Lloyd George—Bishop
Welldon—Dr Walford Davies</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Mrs Annie Besant</span>, like her Himalayan
Mahatmas, is lofty, remote, and difficult of
access. Only once was I admitted to The
Presence. What drove me there was, first of all, curiosity,
and, secondly, a feeling of great respect for her which I
had retained from boyhood. I admired her courage, her
independence, her friendship with and loyalty to Bradlaugh;
moreover, I have always held in high regard those
who, from temperamental or spiritual discord with their
fellows, have kicked over the intellectual traces and run
a race of their own. Annie Besant, whatever else she
may be, is a woman of courage, of vast resource and of
indomitable will.</p>

<p>But alas! my hour’s interview with her did much to
sap and destroy my devotion. First of all, I must say
that, previous to meeting her, I had been for a short time
an Associate of the Theosophical Society. I was never
admitted to membership of that body because I never
claimed the privilege; my associateship originated in my
desire to hear Orage lecture and in my anxiety to study
some curious and not unintelligent people at first hand.
Nothing is at once more distressing and more repellent to
me than affectation, and the affectation of most members
of the Theosophical Society whom I met was really appalling.
The people were also grotesque. The men had
dyspepsia<!-- TN: original reads "dyspepia" --> and bald heads, and the women wore djibbahs
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and a look of condescending benevolence. They read
Madame Blavatsky assiduously and gabbled nonsense to
each other.</p>

<p>Mrs Besant made an appointment for me one Saturday
afternoon at the Midland Hotel, Manchester. I was
shown into a private sitting-room which, upon entering, I
took to be empty. But, after a few moments had passed,
I observed a snake-like movement in a corner of the room,
and a thin, pale lady advanced languidly towards me,
holding out a lifeless hand which hung nervelessly at her
wrist. I glanced at her in surprise and noticed that she
wore a djibbah, a long necklace of yellow stones, a most
insincere smile, and vegetarian boots.</p>

<p>“Mrs Besant will be with you shortly,” she said,
scrutinising me carefully. Having, as it appeared to me,
taken a mental inventory of my clothing, she glided to the
door and, smiling at me once more, disappeared. I took
her to be a sort of bodyguard.</p>

<p>The entrance of Mrs Besant was brisk and businesslike.
She had a firm handshake; she looked a capable
business woman—a woman accustomed to issuing commands
and having them implicitly obeyed. Of medium
height, she was plump and heavily built; her pale face,
surmounted by perfectly white hair, was of an intensely
serious cast, and I saw no humour in her eye.</p>

<p>Our conversation, a little halting at first, began to flow
quite easily when I mentioned her Autobiography and
asked her why she had not issued a second volume.</p>

<p>“You see,” I said, “it stops just at the most interesting
period of your life. You have never stated fully how you
became convinced of the truth of theosophical doctrines.
I, for one, cannot understand your position.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t very necessary that you should,” she observed
calmly.</p>

<p>“Who am I, you mean, that I should presume to
understand you?”</p>

<p><a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Yes; perhaps I meant something like that. People
who are intended to understand me will understand me.
The rest don’t matter. In any case, this is not a subject
that has much interest for me.”</p>

<p>“But, surely, if you think you have discovered the
truth, you are anxious to spread it? As a matter of fact,
I know, of course, that you are anxious on this point, or
you would not lecture and write.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” she said, leaning forward a
little. “I spread the truth, but, then, the truth is not
for everybody. Much of it falls on stony ground.”</p>

<p>“And it will continue to do so,” I half interrupted,
“until you have proved that the alleged miracles of
Madame Blavatsky are really true. Was Madame
Blavatsky a charlatan or was she not?—on the answer
to that question all modern theosophy stands or
falls.”</p>

<p>She smiled at this attack of mine and at the violence
of it.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> proved,” she answered; “it is proved up to the
hilt. I and thousands of others are entirely satisfied.”</p>

<p>“And Madame Coulomb?—was she a mountebank?
And were the mysteries of Adyar frauds?”</p>

<p>“Everyone is entitled to his own opinion about those
matters. I have my own view; you, no doubt, have
yours. And now,” she added, a little wearily, “let us
have tea and talk about the weather.”</p>

<p>Such was the substance of our talk. I gathered the
impression, right or wrong, that Mrs Besant had brought
herself to a state of mind when no evidence, however
strong, that was opposed to her beliefs would shake her
faith for a moment. She desired most fervently to believe
in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fides</i> of Madame Blavatsky, and believe
she did. The Theosophical Society does not—or it did
not in those days—demand from its members the acceptance
of any particular doctrine; you could accept as
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little or as much as you wanted and still remain one of the
faithful. But Mrs Besant went the whole hog.</p>

<p>Bernard Shaw once told me that, meeting Mrs Besant
years after the Bradlaugh days, he said to her, half
jokingly:</p>

<p>“You surely don’t believe one quarter of the rubbish
you write and talk, do you?”</p>

<p>Her answer was to look at him coldly and turn on her
heel. Which, after all, was perhaps the wisest answer
she could give.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>A kindly old man took me to his studio and began to
talk of Dickens. He spoke of those Victorian days as
though they were the greatest that have ever been. He
knew Anthony Trollope and all his works and looked
askance at me because <cite>Barchester Towers</cite> was the only
Trollope book I had read.</p>

<p>And then he took me to an easel and showed me his
latest work—a “pretty-pretty” picture of a girl in a
garden; the sort of picture that, according to my mood,
either excites my laughter or throws me into a fury of rage.</p>

<p>But Marcus Stone was very old, and his ideals, being
those of yesteryear, left me untouched. The young can
never understand the old and, as I listened to him talking
of art and literature and life, I told myself that we to-day
are centuries away from the mid-Victorian days. If he had
not been so old and kindly I should have wished to say:</p>

<p>“Do you want to know what all you people were like
fifty years ago?—well, read <cite>Punch</cite> for, say, the year
1870.”</p>

<p>But though my friends tell me that I am brutal, and I
know I am ill-mannered, I could not find it in my heart to
speak those words.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>The amiable but rather weak Mr P. W. Wilson, who
used to do “Lobby” work for <cite>The Daily News</cite>, having
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>declined a whisky, entered into conversation with me at
the hotel at Criccieth. He told me that till that morning
he had been staying with Mr Lloyd George, but that, Mr Masterman, Sir Rufus Isaacs and other people of importance
having turned up, he himself had had to seek refuge
in the hotel.</p>

<p>The occasion of the assembly of these wits was the
opening of an institute at Llanystumdwy, the little village
near Criccieth, where the Prime Minister spent his childhood
days. Mr Lloyd George had given the institute to
the inhabitants of the village and was himself to open it
publicly the following day.</p>

<p>Mr Wilson’s amiability and his self-satisfaction at
enjoying the friendship of Mr Lloyd George rather put
me out, and I felt a strong desire to disturb his sleek
smoothness.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said I, “that the suffragettes will not be
brutally treated to-morrow, but I am very much afraid
they will.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” observed P. W. W., between draws at his
pipe, “if they create a disturbance here, in the very midst
of Lloyd George’s worshippers, they must expect a stiff
time of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they will get it. The organised gang of
roughs from Portmadoc who are coming here to-morrow
armed with clubs will see to that. The uneducated Welsh,
their passions once aroused, are little better than
savages....” I hesitated a moment. Then, as impressively
as I could, I added: “We must prepare ourselves
for dreadful sights to-morrow. I should not be
very surprised if one or two women are not torn limb from
limb. And if they are, the responsibility will, in my
opinion, rest mainly with Mr Lloyd George himself.”</p>

<p>P. W. Wilson took his pipe from his mouth and looked
at me with some concern.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” he asked.</p>

<p><a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Well, hitherto he has not done very much to soothe
the irritation of meetings he has addressed which have
been interrupted by suffragettes. Lloyd George has not
very much magnanimity. Moreover, in this particular
matter, he evinces but a shallow knowledge of human
nature. He would win the approval of all men of generous
and chivalrous natures <span class="nw">if——”</span></p>

<p>I allowed my voice to die away to nothing.</p>

<p>Wilson, really disturbed, moved a little uneasily on his
chair, rose, scratched his head, sat down again and sighed.</p>

<p>“I must tell him,” said he. “I must warn him that,
at the very beginning of his speech, he must appeal to the
audience to deal gently with any interrupters.... Torn
limb from limb.... You really think that?”</p>

<p>I felt a little sorry to have disturbed him so much,
and yet I knew that I very much preferred an anxious,
harassed Wilson to a Wilson who was smooth and sleek.</p>

<p>Next morning at breakfast he was again smooth and
self-satisfied.</p>

<p>“I have seen him,” he whispered, like a conspirator;
“I have seen him. It is arranged. Everything is all
right.”</p>

<p>Later on that morning I was myself received by Mr Lloyd George in his house. I went prejudiced against
him and determined at all hazards not to allow myself to
be won over by that charm of manner of which I had
heard so much.</p>

<p>But in five minutes I had succumbed. He has a
wonderful gift of making you feel that he thinks you are
the most interesting and most intelligent person he has
ever met. What he really does think, I suppose, is that
you (of course, I don’t mean you; I mean myself) are an
unmitigated bore, and while his eyes are smiling at you he
is really saying to himself: “Why doesn’t the fellow
go?...” Yes, he has charm. He does not fuss and he
is not over-emphatic in his manner. And he is a most
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>deferential listener. He will even ask you your opinion
about matters of which he knows ten times more than
yourself, and he will do you the honour of arguing with
you.</p>

<p>That afternoon, at the formal ceremony of “opening”
the institute, my warning concerning the suffragettes was
nearly prophetic. Mr Lloyd George, of course, did all in
his power to quell the mob’s anger, but the women were
violently assaulted, their breasts beaten, their clothes
ripped from their backs, their hair torn by the roots from
their heads.... On the edge of the mêlée I saw P. W.
Wilson standing deploring it.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It has always seemed to me an extraordinary thing
that, in company with Dr Walford Davies, I should have
been asked some years ago to be a guest at the annual
dinner of the Church Diocesan Music Society. I am
always ready for adventure, of however hazardous a
nature, so I accepted the invitation even after I had been
told that a speech was expected from me.</p>

<p>Bishop Welldon, arriving late—in fact, I believe he had
dined elsewhere—plumped himself on a chair next to me,
and immediately began to dominate everything and everybody
within a radius of twenty yards. He is one of those
distressing people who <em>will</em> be jocular. And his jocularity
is rather noisy. He laughed a great deal and rubbed his
hands together. And he asked me a question and then
asked me another before I had had time to answer the
first. And, really, he did talk so awfully loudly.... I
had come across him before in trams and shops and
places of that kind, and it was always the same; he
invariably talked <em>at</em> you.... Even in the Manchester
Cathedral, where Dr Kendrick Pyne introduced me to
him, he shouted at me and never allowed me to finish a
sentence.</p>

<p>But I perceive that I am becoming petulant, and I
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ought not to do so for, as a matter of fact, the dinner was
a screamingly funny affair. I had prepared a fierce and
warlike speech, a speech attacking the Society whose
food I had just eaten and whose wine was still warm in my
veins. I am, I suppose, quite the worst speaker in the
world; so I had memorised my speech and, so good I
thought it that I had vastly enjoyed doing so. But
alas! when the minute drew near for me to deliver it, I
found myself in an atmosphere of such conviviality, such
kindness, such flattering attention, that I could not find
it in my heart to deliver the words I had prepared and
memorised. Yet an impromptu speech of a different
tenor was impossible. I simply hadn’t the talent to do it.
My name was called and I rose to my feet.</p>

<p>My speech was offensive: it was meant to be. But
offensive though I knew it to be, I did not know how offensive
it really was. I mentioned the name of Wagner
and, as I did so, I saw Dr Walford Davies shudder
most violently. Though I attacked the Church for her
unimaginative attitude to music, though I stamped on
hymns and hymn tunes, though I slanged the microscopic
brains of many organists, though I said that nearly
all Cathedral music was to me anathema maranatha,
nobody except Bishop Welldon appeared to care in the
least, and he did not care half so much as poor, virginal
Walford Davies, who, at the name of Wagner, shuddered
and put his glass aside.</p>

<p>Davies spoke: earnestly, like St Francis; frenziedly,
like Savonarola; passionately, like Venus ... no! no!
no! ... passionately, like St Paul. Eschew Wagner!
That’s what it all came to.... “Eschew....” Hate
the sin, love the sinner, but most certainly “eschew”
both. His cheeks were very white, his lips pale. He
trembled a little. Wagner, it appeared, was one of the
devils. Ab-so-lute-ly pernicious.... Have you ever
noticed how accurately you can estimate a man by his
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>adjectives? Dr Walford Davies used “pernicious”
eleven times, “poisonous” twice, “very-much-to-be-distrusted”
once, “naughty” once (“this naughty man!”
was the phrase), “unlicensed” thrice, and “immoral”
fifteen times.... I must say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>, that I am writing
from memory and that my memory for figures is
atrocious; still, these adjectives, collectively represent
the impression his speech left on my mind.</p>

<p>After dinner (well, neither after nor before dinner) one
does not ardently desire a speech of that kind. It fell
flat. A fat organist from Bolton (or was it Bacup?)
winked me a fat wink. The man on my left—a young
musical doctor from Cambridge—dug his elbow into my
ribs.</p>

<p>And then came Bishop Welldon’s speech. He was
extraordinarily clever. He said some of the most cutting
things imaginable. He was scathing. He hurt me.
Reaching for my glass, I hastily swallowed the large
brandy I had been careful to ask for beforehand. He
made epigrams, epigrams adapted most skilfully from the
writings of his friend, John Oliver Hobbes. And he spoke
so well; he had presence; he had a manner; he, like Sir
Willoughby Patterne, had a leg ... and a leg that was
gaitered. Perhaps it was the gaiters that did it. One
has heard a good deal lately about the Hidden Hand, but
what about the influence of the Hidden Leg? The leg
hidden under the table? The gaitered leg hidden under
the table? Most of the diners, remembering that Bishop
Welldon was indeed a bishop—though, truly, only, so to
speak, an ex-bishop, and an ex-bishop only of Calcutta,
and now possessing only the powers of a dean (whatever
those powers may be!)—most of the diners, I say, recollecting
that Bishop Welldon was indeed a bishop, looked at
me with eyes of faint hostility or did not look at me
at all.</p>

<p>I was very young, said Bishop Welldon. I was
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>enthusiastic; I was inexperienced; I was “artistic”; I
was a jumper-at-conclusions.</p>

<p>When he finished and, with one of his good-natured
smiles, turned and looked at me, I was crumbling bread
very rapidly, rolling the bread into soiled little pills,
putting the little pills all in a row.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening Bishop Welldon, a little group
of jolly people and I myself sat and smoked and drank
very inferior coffee. Dr Walford Davies did not join us.
He shot little pointed darts at me from his eyes, but
(as, of course, you must have anticipated) when he and I
parted he was most studiously polite.</p>

<p>And, on my way to my tram, I hummed Davies’
<i>Hame! Hame! Hame!</i> to myself and pondered over
the mystery that enables a man to write such a wonderful,
soul-searching melody and yet possess an intellect of
quality only ... well, so-so.</p>

<p class="noindent">Do you know Walford Davies’ setting of that Grace, the
setting he made some years ago for one of the daughters of
the late Canon Gorton? If you do, if, as I do, you adore
its Blake-like simplicity, its Ariel freshness, you will not
mind his hatred of Wagner. Only, it is rather strange,
don’t you think, that we outsiders who love Wagner (and
I believe, don’t you, that all intense lovers of Wagner
must be rather outsiderish?) should be able to love
Walford Davies also, though he (most unhappy!) can’t or
won’t love us?</p>

<p>But it is being borne in upon me that for the last five
minutes I have been writing like the adorable Eve in <cite>The

<h2 title="Chapter III: Frank Harris"><a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>CHAPTER III<br
 />FRANK HARRIS</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">It</span> must have been five or six years ago that a friend
came to me with the news that Frank Harris had
expressed a desire to see some of my verse. Precisely
what my friend had told Harris about me, I do
not know; something very exaggerated, perhaps; something
complimentary, doubtless; something that piqued
Harris’s curiosity, it was evident. As Harris is one of the
few modern writers for whom my boyish admiration has
survived manhood, I felt subtly gratified that he should
take even a fleeting interest in me, and I sat down at once
and copied out various poems that had already appeared
in <cite>The Academy</cite>, under Lord Alfred Douglas’s editorship,
and in <cite>The English Review</cite> in the days of Ford Madox
Hueffer, and, more recently, when edited by Austin
Harrison. With my verses I sent a letter, hypocritically
modest as regards myself, honestly full of admiration as
regards Harris. He replied from his villa in Nice, sending
me a long letter in which he did me the honour to enter
fully into the supposed merits and demerits of my work.
Of one poem he said that it was not sufficiently sensual,
and I have never been able quite to understand what he
meant, for I had, with some particularity, described seven
naked ladies swimming in a pool, and I had felt that my
verses had obviously enough expressed my feelings.</p>

<p>The correspondence continued until, one day, Harris
wrote to tell me he was returning to London and to invite
me to visit him there. In the event, however, my first
meeting with Harris was in Manchester, whither he came
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to lecture on Shakespeare to the local dramatic society.
Jack Kahane (a great friend of mine) and I met him at
the Midland Hotel upon his arrival, and from the very
first moment he intoxicated me. Whilst he changed
from his travelling clothes to evening dress he talked
and ejaculated, beseeching us to remain with him as
he had had “a rotten journey from London and felt
unutterably bored.” I remember very little of what he
said except that, with some venom, he called Browning
“a not unprosperous gentleman.” He refused to eat or
drink before his lecture and, presently, we went down to
the large room in the hotel where he was to speak.</p>

<p>We found there a mixed assembly. Everybody in
Manchester, it should be explained, writes plays; at
least, I never yet met a man in that delectable city who
does not. Moreover, they “study” them. They weigh
and compare the merits of Stanley Houghton and Ibsen,
Harold Brighouse and Strindberg, Allan Monkhouse and
Bjornson, Arnold Bennett and Hauptmann, Laurence
Housman and Brieux, and so forth. They search for
“inner meanings”; the more earnest of them hunt for
“messages”; the more delicate seek to perceive Fine
Shades. They are veritable disciples of Miss Horniman—priggishly
intellectual, self-consciously superior. And,
of course, the rock of their salvation is St Bernard.
Innocuous people enough, but impossible to live in the
same city with.</p>

<p>To this assembly of earnest, pale men and spectacled
women Harris was to lecture, and I looked from them to
Harris and from Harris to them with joyful expectations.
From the very first sentence he was fiery and provocative,
throwing out daring theories, anathematising all forms of
respectability, upholding with unparalleled fierceness a
wonderful ideal of chivalry and nobility and condemning,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bloc</i>, the whole human race, and particularly that portion
of it seated before him. Ladies rustled; men stirred
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>uneasily. Then, having delivered himself of a passage of
hot eloquence, he paused. A clock ticked. He looked
defiantly at us and still paused. A fat lady in the front
row, palpably embarrassed by the long silence and, no
doubt, feeling that she had reached one of the most
dramatic moments of her existence, banged her plump
hands together and ejaculated: “Bravo!” A few other
ladies of both sexes joined her, but Harris was not to be
placated. Thrusting out his chin, he began again. And
this time he attacked the Mancunian literary idol, Professor
C. H. Herford, a great scholar, but a more than suitable
object for Harris’s ridicule. Herford is a man who
has not lived fully: a semi-invalid, asthmatic, bloodless
and spectacled; a man of books and rather dusty books;
in effect, a professor. He had recently reviewed Harris’s
book, <cite>The Man Shakespeare</cite>, in <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>,
and had called it “a disgrace to British scholarship.”
Why this should have annoyed the author I cannot tell,
but Harris is at times a little unreasonable. Indeed,
“annoyance” but feebly describes the feeling that spent
itself in scalding invective and the most terrible irony.
Each sentence he spoke appeared to be the last word in
bitterness; but each succeeding sentence leaped above
and beyond its predecessor, until at length the speaker had
lashed himself into a state of feeling to express which
words were useless. He stopped magnificently, and this
time the room rang with applause. It is probable that
not half-a-dozen people present believed his attack on
Professor Herford was justified; indeed, it is probable that
not half-a-dozen were qualified to form any opinion of
value on the matter. Nevertheless, they applauded him
with enthusiasm, and they did so because they had been
deeply stirred by eloquence that can only be described as
superb and by anger that was lava hot in its sincerity.
Briefly, the lecture was an overwhelming success.</p>

<p>I was soon to discover that Harris, like all the men of
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>genius I have met, is vain. I do not mean that he overrates
his gifts: he does not; nor that his recognition of
his own genius is offensively insistent: such is very far
from being the case. I mean that he is inordinately
proud, innocently and childlikely proud, of things that are
not of the least consequence. At supper in the French
Restaurant the head waiter slipped noiselessly across to
the table at which Harris, Kahane and I were sitting.
(Harris is the kind of man who acts as a magnet to all
head waiters—a high tribute to his dominating personality.)
When our orders had been given the waiter,
turning to go, said: “Very good, Mr Harris.” On the
instant Harris looked up. “So you know me?” he
asked. “Yes, sir. I have had the pleasure of waiting
on you in Monte Carlo and, if I am not mistaken, in
New York as well.” It is difficult to describe the naïve
pleasure Harris took in this: it stamped him at once as a
man of the world—he who, of all people, required, in our
opinion, no such stamp.</p>

<p>For six hours we talked—talked long after every other
visitor in the hotel had retired, and we were left alone in
the Octagon Court in a pool of dim light. Harris is the only
brilliant talker I have met who has not made me feel an
abject idiot. To begin with, though he has a pronounced
strain of violence, almost of brutality, in his nature, he is
always infinitely courteous. He will listen to your (I
mean my) feeble contributions to a discussion with interest
which, if feigned, is so admirably feigned that you are
completely deceived. And he can keep this sort of thing
up indefinitely. Moreover, though his mind is agile
enough, his speech is rarely quick; it is slow and deliberate,
but without hesitation, without a single word
of tautology.</p>

<p>I cannot hope, after so long a lapse of time, to reproduce,
however faintly, the true quality of Harris’s conversation,
but I remember the substance of it most
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>vividly. In his lecture earlier in the evening he had
mentioned Jesus Christ, and the reference to our Saviour
had been so original in its implication, yet so reverent in
its manner, that I felt he must have much that is new to
say on a subject that has aroused more discussion than any
other during the last two thousand years. So I broached
it tentatively. He was aroused immediately, and skilfully
drew me out to discover if I had anything new to say. I
had not. I merely voiced what must be an age-long
regret, that only one side of Christ’s nature has been presented
to us in the Gospels; that the feasting, joyous
Christ has been only faintly indicated; and that His
tolerance towards the weaknesses of the body’s passions
had always been shirked by those of the priestly craft. I
thought it possible that at some future crisis in the world’s
history Christ might come again and, on His second
coming, present to the world a more complete embodiment
of all the potentialities inherent in human nature.</p>

<p>With much of this Harris agreed, though I soon perceived
that his mind had for long been intuitively building
up, and giving true proportion to, those elements in
Christ’s nature that are only hinted at in the Gospels.
He was all for a full-blooded, passionate Jesus, for a Jesus
who had tested the body’s powers, for a Jesus who was
crucified by passion before He was crucified by Pilate.
In a word, he applied to Jesus the same intuitive method
that he had already applied to Shakespeare. The danger
of this method, of course, is that one is tempted (and it is
almost impossible not to succumb to the temptation) to
project one’s own personality into that of the man one is
studying.</p>

<p>“My next book shall be about Jesus Christ,” said
Harris. “No man in these days has written honestly
about Him.”</p>

<p>“Shall you write as a believer?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” he replied.</p>

<p><a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Then Harris told us some stories—stories he had
written, stories he had yet to write. I remember Austin
Harrison once saying to me: “Frank Harris is the most
astounding creature! He will tell you a story and tell it
so marvellously that, when he has finished, you say to
yourself: ‘That is the most wonderful thing I have ever
heard.’ And you say to him: ‘Why, in God’s name,
don’t you write that?’ Well, he does write it, and when
you read it you see that, after all, it is by no means so
wonderful a thing as you had thought it.” But this is only
half true. The story that is told is a very different thing
from the story that is written: so different, indeed, that
one cannot find any basis for comparison. In telling a
story Harris is elliptical; a faint gesture serves for a
sentence; a momentary silence is an innuendo; a lifting
of the eyebrows, a look, a dropping of the voice, a slowness
in his speech—all these take the place of words. He is an
exquisite actor and he is at his best when he is sinister and
menacing. One need scarcely say that the effect of one
of Harris’s stories, told in private, with only one or two
listeners, is extremely powerful, for his personality, so
quick to melt and suffuse his speech—colouring it and
vitalising it—is strong and strange and full of tropical
<span class="nw">richness....</span></p>

<p>But the actor’s gift is not rare, whereas that combination
of talents that makes a great short-story writer is met
with only once or twice in a generation. Harris’s claims
to greatness in this direction cannot justly be denied,
though of late years there has been a noticeable tendency
to treat his work as though it were not of first-rate importance.
His choice of subject, the violence of his
thought, his strict honesty of mind, his open contempt
for many of his contemporaries—these have brought him
enemies whose only method of retaliation is to decry work
they will not understand.</p>

<p>But Harris could not be happy without hostility.
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There is something of the jaguar in his nature; he must,
for his soul’s peace, have his teeth in the flesh of an enemy.
And, if he is not fighting an individual, he is offending
society at large. Years ago, so Harris told me, when he
was editing <cite>The Fortnightly Review</cite> with such distinction,
he printed one of his own short stories in that magazine—a
story that, for one reason or another, gave great offence
to a large section of readers. Within twenty-four hours
he had a hornet’s nest about his ears, and the directors
of the firm, Messrs Chapman &amp; Hall, who published the
<cite>Fortnightly</cite>, met in solemn conclave to discuss what should
be done with so injudicious and reckless an editor. Needless
to say, Harris stood by his guns, and one can imagine
the splendidly arrogant way in which he would uphold his
right to insert anything he chose in a magazine edited by
himself. But discussion made matters only more critical,
and Harris told me he would have been compelled to
hand in his resignation if an unforeseen event had not
occurred. That event was the entrance of George Meredith,
who, at that time, was a reader for Messrs Chapman
&amp; Hall. As soon as his eyes lit on Harris he held out his
hand, and walked quickly up to him, saying: “My warmest
congratulations! Your story in the new number is
quite the finest thing you have done—an honour to yourself
and the <cite>Fortnightly</cite>!” That left no further room
for discussion and, needless to say, Harris retained his
editorship of the great magazine.</p>

<p>My first meeting with Harris was of the friendliest
nature, and on his return to London he wrote to me
thanking me for something I had written about him in
<cite>The Manchester Courier</cite>. (I noticed with amusement
that <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, unable, no doubt, to forgive
Harris for attacking Professor Herford, had absolutely
ignored the Shakespeare lecture, except to announce
baldly that it had been given.)</p>

<p>Very soon after this meeting in Manchester I went to
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>live in London, and called on Harris in Chancery Lane.
He was running a curious illustrated weekly, entitled
<cite>Hearth and Home</cite>, and I remember sitting in a little back
room in his office turning over the files<!-- TN: "e" invisible --> of his magazine
and wondering what on earth he hoped to do with such a
production. It was tame; it was watery; it was feeble.
I looked at him quizzically.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you see?...” I began hesitatingly;
“don’t you see that ... well, now, look at the <em>title</em>!”</p>

<p>“Title’s good enough, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, good enough ... good enough for Fleetway
House. Why not sell it to Northcliffe? But you’ve got
no Aunt Maggie’s column, and no Beauty Hints, and no
Cupid’s Corner! Oh, Harris!”</p>

<p>He laughed, and invited me out to lunch.</p>

<p>I never discovered what strange circumstances had conspired
to make him the possessor of this extraordinary
production. No doubt he bought it for nothing, with the
intention of rapidly improving it and selling it for something
substantial later on. But I believe it died soon
after—perhaps urged on to its grave by some verses of
mine which were printed close to an advertisement of
ladies’ ——.</p>

<p>On our way out of the office we were joined by a very
beautiful lady who, it soon transpired, shared my admiration
for Harris’s genius. We jumped on to a bus running
at full speed and alighted, a couple of minutes later, at
Simpson’s.</p>

<p>Harris should write a book on cookery. Perhaps he
will. Harris should run a hotel. But he has already done
so. Harris should be induced to print all the indiscreet
things he says over coffee and <span class="nw">liqueurs....</span></p>

<p>It was a close study of Simpson’s menu that started the
cookery discussion. The Beautiful Lady and I were told
what was wrong and what was right with the menu. And
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>then there began a discourse, profound, full of strange
knowledge and recondite wisdom, a discourse that Balzac
should have heard, that the de Goncourts would have
envied. We listened, amazed. And a waiter, having
rushed to our table in the stress of his work, stood
anchored, his mouth slightly open, his whole attention
riveted on the Master from whom no gastronomic secrets
were hid. Truly, Harris was amazing!</p>

<p>After a considerable time his enthusiasm evaporated
and we began to eat. And then ensued a long talk, full of
indiscretions, of most enjoyable malice. Harris told us
many things that, perhaps, it would have been wiser if he
had kept to himself. But, in spite of his venom, his real
hatred of certain individuals, he never for a moment permits
himself to be blinded to the quality of a man’s work.</p>

<p>“So-and-so is the most detestable person,” he said,
speaking of a well-known writer, “but he is one of the few
real poets alive.” Again: “X is the most generous-hearted
man I have ever met; it’s a pity he can’t learn to
write.”</p>

<p>Mention of Richard Middleton, who had only recently
died by his own hand in Brussels, troubled him, and it was
clear that he had not yet recovered from the shock of this
tragedy.</p>

<p>“He killed himself in a mood of sheer disgust—disgust
at his lack of success. True, he was still young, and was
becoming more widely known month by month; also, he
had many friends. Nevertheless, life did not give him
what he asked and, tired of asking, he ended life. I
remember him coming to me just before he left England.
He wanted to get away. Some mood of loathing had
come to him; he was fretful, yet determined. I offered
him my villa at Nice; it was empty, the caretaker would
attend to his wants and he would have ample leisure for
his work. He hesitated, stayed in London a day or two
longer and then disappeared to Brussels.... I know the
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>poison he used, and a score of times I have gone over in my
mind the tortures he must have endured.”</p>

<p>Harris paled; his face twitched and, involuntarily, as
it seemed, his shoulders twisted themselves. Brooding,
he was silent for a few minutes, and then, collecting himself
with a little shudder, began to speak of other things.</p>

<p>A little later the Beautiful Lady departed and we were
left alone.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Harris, “tell me about yourself.
What are you doing? Why have you left Manchester?—but
there is no reason to ask that. Tell me this—are you
making enough money for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve lived in London just one week,” said I,
“and my tastes are rather expensive. Just before I left
Manchester a very experienced journalist told me I should
be making a thousand pounds a year at the end of eighteen
months; another, equally experienced, declared I should
never make more than six pounds a week. I hope the
second one won’t prove correct.”</p>

<p>He mused for a few moments.</p>

<p>“You ought to make a thousand pounds a year pretty
easily, I should think,” he said at length. “Whom do
you know?”</p>

<p>I knew nobody, and said so. He thereupon took a
piece of paper from his pocket and wrote a list of names;
at the top of the list stood J. L. Garvin; at the bottom,
Lord Northcliffe.</p>

<p>“Northcliffe’s away,” he said, “buying forests in Newfoundland
to make paper with. However, he’ll be back
in a week or two, and in the meantime I’ll write you a
letter to give to him. And now we’ll take a taxi and see
people.”</p>

<p>Harris gave up the whole of that day to me and, largely
owing to him, I had within the next few days more work
offered to me than I could possibly get through. From
time to time, months later, good things would come my
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>way, and nearly always I could trace them to something
generous and fine that Harris had said of me.</p>

<p>It was chiefly because he was so generous with his time
that I so rarely called upon him. Often I would curb a
strong desire to see him, feeling that however embarrassing
my visit might be, he would, out of a quixotic kindness,
throw up his work and come with me to talk. For
this reason I had not seen him for some little time, when,
one morning, I received a letter from him reproaching me
for my absence. “Why have you hidden yourself for so
long?” he asked. “I go to the Café every night; come,
you will find me there.”</p>

<p>“The Café,” of course, was the Café Royal. It so
chanced that, that very afternoon, my duties took me to
a symphony concert in the Queen’s Hall; the concert
over, I found myself passing the Café Royal on my way
from the Queen’s Hall to Piccadilly Circus, and turned in
on the remote chance of finding Harris.</p>

<p>At the end of the passage, near the windows where
French papers are displayed, I found a crowd of a dozen
excited men, all talking and gesticulating. The rest of
the Café was empty, as one would expect at that time of
the day. In the middle of the small crowd was Harris,
who caught my eye almost at once. He came to me, and
I saw that he was rather agitated.</p>

<p>“Come and sit over here, Cumberland,” he said.
“I’ve just been through a beastly quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>It appeared that a well-known and very distinguished
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</i> had quarrelled with him in the Café....
Blows had been <span class="nw">exchanged....</span></p>

<p>We talked of money—an ever-absorbing topic both to
Harris and to me. He told me his books had brought
him practically nothing. For <cite>The Bomb</cite>, if I remember
correctly, he received fifty pounds—certainly not more
than one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>“If I had been compelled to live by what my books
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have brought me,” he said, “I should have starved. Yet
it is not long ago that Arnold Bennett assured me that I
should be able to earn five thousand pounds a year if
I gave my whole time to fiction. But Bennett is wrong.
My books, ever since <cite>Elder Conklin</cite> was published, have
been enthusiastically praised, but they have not had large
sales. Most authors must find book-writing the most
unremunerative work in the world. I put an enormous
amount of labour into <cite>The Bomb</cite>, as I do into all my
books, and the labour was not made any the less from
the fact that much of the earliest part of the book
is autobiographical. In my young manhood I worked
as a labourer, deep under water, at the foundations of
Brooklyn Bridge; it is all described in my book.”</p>

<p>Though I went to the Café Royal at frequent intervals
after that I very rarely saw Harris there. He had
abandoned <cite>Hearth and Home</cite>, or it had abandoned him, and
he was now throwing away his brilliant gifts on <cite>Modern
Society</cite>. I was elected an honorary member of the
Cabaret Club, run by Madame Strindberg, the widow of
the great Swedish writer, and I used to look in there
occasionally in the early hours of the morning, expecting
to run across Harris, who, I heard, also visited that exotic,
underground and rather riotous place. But I never
chanced to see him, and two or three months must have
passed without my hearing of him.</p>

<p>In March, 1914, I went to Athens for a holiday. Something
brave and wonderful in that city, some ancient
Bacchic madness, some fierce exaltation of soul took hold
of me, and I remember sitting down one night, after a
visit to fever-stricken Eleusis, to write to Harris, feeling
the necessity of expressing myself to one who would understand.
The reader may be amused that I should think
Harris akin to ancient Greece, but if the reader is amused
he does not know Harris. Only A. R. Orage is more
Greek in spirit than he is. In reply Harris wrote at great
<a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>length, full of the fervour of a young student. He told me
that in his young manhood he had spent a year of study
in that wonderful city, and urged me to visit him on my
return to England.</p>

<p>But I was destined not to see him again. Very soon
after my return to England he got into trouble with reference
to something libellous that he had published in
<cite>Modern Society</cite>. He was kept in prison, if I remember
rightly, for about a month. I sought permission to visit
him there, but was refused, and I was staying in Oxford
when he was released.</p>

<p>Soon after the war broke out he wrote me the following
letter from <span class="nw">Paris:—</span></p>

<!-- blockquote -->
<p class="extraspace2"><span class="address"><span class="smc">23, Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, Paris</span>,<br
 />29<i>th Aug.</i> ’14.</span></p>

<p><span class="smc">My dear Cumberland</span>,—I’m just back from the
frontier.... This war of nations is going to test every
man as by fire before it’s over. It will be long in spite of
Mr Kipps and Bernard Shaw. The Russian masses will
hardly come decisively into action (they have scarcely any
railways and no good roads) till next May or June, and
long before then, or rather in a couple of months from now,
the French will be pressed back to within twenty miles of
besieged Paris, when I hope the English forces on the
flank will stop the German advance. Then will begin the
slow process of driving the Germans home, which will be
quickened by the Russian weight behind Cossack pricks.
Fancy one <em>man</em> having the power to set 400 millions of
men fighting for their lives. And then they talk of man
as a rational animal!!</p>

<p>Don’t say you like what I wrote in <cite>The Daily Sketch</cite>;
all my best things were carefully cut out and filled up with
drivel, till my cheeks burned.</p>

<p>Your sketch of me is very kindly; the fault you find in
me is not a fault. Jesus, Shakespeare, Napoleon—all the
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>greatest men have known their own value and insisted on
it—perhaps because they have all <cite>come to their own and
their own received them not</cite>. When you have done great
work you feel it is not yours, but given to you; you are
only a reed shaken in the wind; you can judge it as if it
had nothing to do with you. Moreover, you see that this
failure to recognise greatness is the capital sin of all time,
the sin against the Holy Ghost which He said could never
be forgiven. Modesty is the fig-leaf of mediocrity—don’t
let us talk of it. Remember how Whistler scourged it.</p>

<p>I’m writing now on <cite>Natural Religion</cite>—my best thing
yet: I’ve done more than Nietzsche: don’t think I’m
bragging. I am the Reconciler; though my cocked nose
and keen eyes may make you think me a combatant.
Twenty years hence, Cumberland, if your eyes keep their
promise, you’ll think differently of me. I remember as a
young man getting Wagner to praise himself and saying to
myself that no man was ever so conceited as the little
hawk-faced fellow with the ploughshare chin. Did he not
say that the step from Bach to Beethoven was not so
great as that from Beethoven to Wagner! And yet for
these fifteen years past I have agreed with him and find
nothing conceited in the declaration. Only weak men are
hurt by another man’s conceit; are we not gods also to be
spoken of with reverence?</p>

<p class="extraspace">There is not in this letter a single word to indicate that
he was not, heart and soul, in sympathy with the Allied
Cause. Late in September, 1914, I was myself in Paris,
having visited Amiens and the Marne. I took the earliest
opportunity of calling upon Harris, but discovered that
he had left his rooms a few days earlier, leaving no indication
of his next resting-place. On calling upon the
American Consul I discovered that my friend had already
sailed for the States.</p>

<p>Subsequently he wrote bitterly about England in an
American paper. I never had an opportunity of reading
his articles, but I read various extracts from them in
British newspapers, and was astounded both by the views
they contained and by the manner in which those views
were expressed.</p>

<p>Years ago Ruskin wrote Rossetti a curious letter: he
said he could regard no man as friend who did not value
his (Ruskin’s) gifts as highly as he (Ruskin) did. Harris,
no doubt, adopted the same kind of attitude towards
England. England refused to accept him at his own
estimate and, at length, in fierce disgust, Harris turned his
back on a country which he deemed unworthy of him.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Yvette Guilbert</span>!... Yvette Guilbert! I
suppose that only a writer who really can write
can say anything useful or dignified about this
most wonderful woman.... And yet I must try. Do
you remember that extraordinary breath-catching passage
in <cite>Villette</cite> where Charlotte Brontë describes the acting
of Vashti—Vashti who was Rachel—Vashti who went
to London when Charlotte loved Héger?... That, I
always think, was a great event. Little Currer Bell, with
her most modest mind and her most proud heart, sitting,
so breathlessly, on one side of the footlights, and Rachel
walking from the wings, beyond the footlights, and, like
an empress, speaking, thinking like an empress, and, like
a veritable woman, loving and hating.... Do you remember
that passage? If you do, perhaps you will
think, as I do, that, after all, only women can write of
women. Did not Jane Austen create Elizabeth Bennet?
And who was it who wrote the <cite>Sonnets from the Portuguese</cite>?
And even, after all, Aphra Behn ... well, <em>she</em>
knew something about women, didn’t she?</p>

<p>So that I feel only a woman can write at all convincingly
of Yvette Guilbert. I must just gossip and prattle a
little while.</p>

<p>I must have heard Yvette Guilbert a score of times.
The first occasion was in the Midland Hall, Manchester,
eight or ten years ago, when she sang to an audience of
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>about two hundred frigid people who, apparently, knew
as much French as I know of the language of the Serbs,
and as much about Art as the pencil with which I write
knows about the thoughts it records. Ernest Newman
was there and, that night, wrote an article for <cite>The Manchester
Guardian</cite> that must have more than compensated
Guilbert for the smallness of the audience. For she loves
praise, even the praise she gives herself, as the following
letter addressed to myself will testify:</p>

<p class="extraspace">Guilbert has no singing voice, and yet she sings. Her
singing voice is small ... ever so small. Yet clear, distinct,
expressive and, in the lowest register, most deep and
thrilling. How little mere “voice” matters! Only consider.
Here, on one hand, we have Madame Clara Butt
with, I suppose, one of the most wonderful organs that
this world, or any other world, has ever listened to. But
would you walk five miles to hear her sing? I wouldn’t.
You, I hope and believe, wouldn’t either. Would you
walk five miles to hear Blanche Marchesi sing—Blanche
Marchesi, whose voice, as mere voice, is like a hundred
other voices? Of course you would. Voice matters
little. It is the temperament, the intellect, behind the
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>voice that counts. And the eternal struggle that Yvette
Guilbert has had to undergo has been the struggle to make
her comparatively small voice express the wonderful
things of her imagination.</p>

<p>A gesture. A look. An inflection. Two paces on the
platform. A little cry ... a little cry of dismay. A
superb and beautiful signal that tells us the Mother of God
is big with a Child. A tiny silence. A moment of jauntiness.
Something arch and irresistible. Something tragic
that makes you clench your <span class="nw">fists....</span></p>

<p>One day Yvette Guilbert wrote to ask me to call on her.
I did not go. One feels so foolish in the presence of genius.
One’s vanity is hurt. One is afraid of being found out.</p>

<p>In the early days of the war I visited Sir Victor Horsley
several times at his home. I was interested in shell
shock, in the influence that the horror of war has on
certain types of human nature, and he was good enough
to supply me with a great deal of information. Quiet
and undemonstrative, he used always to stand, or move
slowly up and down the room; in the long talks we had
together, I do not remember his sitting down once.</p>

<p>I don’t think I ever met a man more careful to express
his exact meaning; he appeared to have a horror of
exaggeration and he qualified nearly every statement he
made. In discussing scientific subjects such scrupulous
carefulness is, of course, not only wise but necessary, and
when, later on, I wrote a newspaper article on the effect
that the strain and horror of war have on the human
brain, Sir Victor showed himself very anxious that, in
quoting his views, I should do so in language that could
not possibly be interpreted in two different senses.</p>

<p>He told me what my own experience in France and
Salonica in 1915–1917 confirmed later on, that it is frequently
the neurotic, the artistic, the excitable man who
most quickly adapts himself to, and is least disturbed by,
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the incredible cruelties of warfare, whilst the phlegmatic
type of man is more liable to be broken by those cruelties.
Sir Victor Horsley suggested that this was, in some
measure, due to the fact that the neurotic man has, in
imagination, tasted the terror of war before he has actually
experienced it; that he has, as it were, prepared his mind
for the shock it is to receive. The unimaginative man
cannot do this, so that when his turn comes to go to the
trenches and witness stark horrors, his nervous system
reacts most violently.</p>

<p>Sir Victor spoke a good deal to me about the evil
influence of drink, and continually regretted that rum was
served out to our soldiers. On this subject, of course,
though I disagreed with him profoundly, I did not attempt
to argue, though I pointed out that Napoleon had won
many of his campaigns by almost drugging his men with
spirits. To this he made no reply, though he shook his
head gravely and seemed to ponder a little.</p>

<p>My last interview with him was in his long, bare dining-room,
where, as we stood before the fire, he described to
me in a low, serious voice two or three war cases of mental
trouble (functional, of course, not organic), and I could
see that the war was, so to speak, closing in around him and
enveloping him with its violent appeals, its tragic interests.</p>

<p>Mrs Pankhurst I met only once, but the impression she
has left on my mind is that of a most vivid personality. I
saw her in many ridiculous situations that would have
made almost any other person look positively foolish;
but Mrs Pankhurst’s sense of personal dignity is so strong,
her personality is so imperious, and, above all, she
possesses so much humour and good sense, that it is impossible
to imagine any situation, however grotesque,
that would render her ridiculous.</p>

<p>My interview with her was at the close of a day during
which she had worked incessantly. She was tired, and
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her face was lined and rather dim. An hour earlier I had
seen her in Oxford Street, Manchester, seated in an open,
horseless carriage, a dozen enthusiastic girls pulling at the
shafts, a few ribald boys following and shouting small
obscenities. I admired the perfect way she carried off
the trying situation. She sat perfectly calmly, as though
nothing in the least unusual were happening, as though,
indeed, it were her daily custom, and the daily custom of
all women, to be dragged through the public streets by a
band of young ladies.</p>

<p>We sat under a lamp at a large table. The things we
discussed are now of no consequence, for the need for their
discussion no longer exists. I can only give my impression
of her.</p>

<p>She struck me as being unutterably weary, weary
bodily and perhaps mentally. Her personality suggested
a body and a spirit being driven by an implacable will, a
will that had no mercy for herself or for others, a will that
no power could break. I could not help wondering, as I
looked at her, whether she had not her moments of doubt,
of self-distrust. She must have had, for all men and
women have. But those moments would be few and
short. Though she spoke to me very quietly, without a
gesture, with one rather tightly clenched hand on the
table, I felt the sheer <em>power</em> of her, the power that a
quenchless spirit always gives to its owner.</p>

<p>Fanatic? Well, yes, if to be indifferent to the opinion
of other people and to be absolutely sure of yourself is to
be fanatical. Certainly, she was strange and grim and
relentless. And yet one could not doubt her tenderness,
her deep sympathy, her devotion to humanity. Yes, a
strange woman, but perhaps not so very strange. The
qualities I saw in her are common qualities; the difference
between her and others was simply that she possessed
those qualities in an unusual degree.</p>

 /></span></span></a>Jacob Epstein, after flouting the artistic conventions
for at least ten years, is being taken to the heart of the
public. The impossible is happening, and it is happening
because of the war. The war has forced reality upon us;
it has made us love beauty rather than prettiness, truth
rather than make-believe, the soul of things rather than
their appearances.</p>

<p>Epstein, I think, could never be said to be in revolt
against any of the artistic tendencies of the time. He
simply did not follow those tendencies or permit them to
influence him. But three or four years ago, when I first
met him, he had the appearance, the manner, and even the
thoughts of one who is in revolt.</p>

<p>I remember discussing with him some very curious and,
indeed, rather alarming designs of his which were being
exhibited at a little gallery whose name I have forgotten.
The designs were openly and widely described as “indecent”;
to me they were not indecent: they were merely
meaningless. I could see no idea behind them.</p>

<p>“They are not designs,” said Epstein, a little petulantly,
I thought.</p>

<p>“Then what <em>are</em> they?” I asked. “What do <em>you</em> call
them?”</p>

<p>“I am not aware that I call them anything.”</p>

<p>“But what do they <em>mean</em>?”</p>

<p>He smiled curiously and (we were sitting in the Café
Royal) lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Ah! That is for you to find out. Surely you don’t
expect an artist to explain himself?”</p>

<p>Of course he was perfectly right, and I was more
than foolish to ask him these questions. But I flogged
at it.</p>

<p>“Now, your busts! Especially that wonderful head
of Augustus John’s son!—beautiful, marvellous! But
those extraordinary red drawings.”</p>

<p>“I cannot explain them,” said he, “but I would
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>certainly like you to understand them, for it seems to me
that you are not unintelligent.”</p>

<p>He gave me a quick, sly look, and we began to talk of
John. I am afraid that Epstein must have qualified his
opinion of my intelligence, for he asserted, in contradiction
to what I was saying, that John was on the wrong tack,
and we failed to come to any agreement about this most
wonderful of living painters.</p>

<p>Like most artists, Epstein is pronouncedly inarticulate.
He is, I suppose, as much a mystery to himself as he is to
others. But his work is, of course, a hundred times more
interesting than himself.</p>

<p>I used to see him often, but we rarely did more than
acknowledge each other’s existence, and when I saw him
the other week in khaki, sitting in the Café Royal, it was
clear to me that, though he said he remembered me, he
had only a vague recollection of my personality and had
completely forgotten my name.</p>

<p>I have often thought it strange that while singers like
Madame Patti and Madame Tetrazzini should conquer the
world—and by the world I mean every section of the
musical public, vulgar and fastidious alike—another and,
to my mind, a very much finer artiste, Madame Ackté,
should be regarded with delight only by those whose
musical experience is wide and whose minds have been
tutored by comprehensive study. Personality, after all,
is almost everything in Art, and Madame Ackté has
a personality that dwarfs into insignificance nearly all
singers who are her equal in technical attainments and in
musical subtlety.</p>

<p>Her great part is Salomé, in Richard Strauss’s opera of
that name. With the wonderful intuition of a healthy,
robust mind she has divined all the perverted wickedness
of that most tortured woman. Her acting is among
the finest things of our day.</p>

demure woman, that she has in her such fires of passion,
such powers of portraying devastating wickedness. She
has charm, graciousness<!-- TN: original reads "graciousnness" -->, simplicity. Like Yvette Guilbert,
she has worked hard almost every day of her life.
Her talk is all of music and acting. She seems most unmodern.
Her ingenuous love of praise is delightful, and
if you notice the little subtleties in her singing and acting
that most people do not notice, she is your friend for ever.</p>

 />STANLEY HOUGHTON AND HAROLD
BRIGHOUSE</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcapB">But</span> perhaps you have forgotten who Stanley
Houghton was? Well, not so long before the
Great War he was famous, both in England and
America, as the author of <cite>Hindle Wakes</cite>, he was universally
alluded to as a charming personality, and he promised
to become one of the most prosperous playwrights in
England. Then, while still young and not yet accustomed
to his fame, he died in Italy. Thereupon some thousand
newspaper-writers recorded his death and wrote about
him some of the most lamentable nonsense it has ever been
my misfortune to read.</p>

<p>Let me tell you all about it.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Stanley Houghton in Manchester
by Jack Kahane—the latter a most brilliant and engaging
personality who knew everybody: or, rather, everybody
knew him.</p>

<p>“This,” said Kahane, indicating Houghton, “is one of
Miss Horniman’s pets. She is doing a play of his this
week at the Gaiety. Now, let me see, Stanley, what is
the name of your little play?”</p>

<p>Houghton laughed deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw it last night,” said I, “and jolly good it
was. But I’ve seen another play of yours besides <cite>The
Younger Generation</cite>; it was founded on a story by Guy
de Maupassant. That, also, was tremendously amusing.”</p>

<p>He frowned, and I understood from the way that he
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>looked over my head that I had displeased him. For a
moment he was silent, then:</p>

<p>“I’ve just been reading some of your verses in <cite>The
English Review</cite>,” said he; “quite nice, quite nice.”</p>

<p>So then I examined him closely and saw a tall, fair
youth, with plenty of straw-coloured hair, a prominent,
rather crooked nose, and a manner of painful self-consciousness.
I believe that, from that moment, we
distrusted each other most heartily. We parted a few
minutes later and I think Houghton must have shared
my suspicion and regret that we should often have to
meet after that date. Kahane was and is (though he
has been in France these three years and I in Macedonia)
my most intimate friend, and had lately “taken up”
Houghton, and whenever Kahane did a thing he did it
pretty thoroughly. And friends of a friend are bound to
tumble across each other continually.</p>

<p>Later in the day I protested to Kahane.</p>

<p>“What on earth has induced you to take up this man
Houghton?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He amuses me,” said Jack. “And, really, you
know, one or two of his little things are quite promising.
When he bores me I rag him. And then he loses
his temper. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il m’amuse</i>, and that’s all I require from
him.”</p>

<p>Shortly after I was elected a member of a funny little
coterie in Manchester, called the Swan Club. Kahane
had founded it. There were twelve of us altogether:
Kahane; Stanley Houghton; Harold Brighouse (whose
play, <cite>Hobson’s Choice</cite>, is making “big money” in London
at the moment of writing); Charles Abercrombie (now a
Lt.-Colonel and a C.B.); Walter Mudie, the best of good
fellows; Ernest Marriott, artist; W. Price-Heywood,
accountant and leader-writer; myself and a few hangers-on
of the Arts. We used to meet for lunch at a shabby
little restaurant in Peter Street, Manchester, opposite the
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Theatre Royal, and we did our utmost to induce each
other to talk about ourselves.</p>

<p>In this little coterie Houghton was a veritable whale
among the minnows. He was also a fish out of water.
From the very first his success spoiled him. He would
take himself ponderously. Brighouse worshipped success,
so he worshipped Houghton. The rest of us, if we worshipped
anything at all, worshipped genius, and as Kahane
was the only one among us who had a touch of that divine
quality, we rather tended to worship him. But Kahane
frittered away his gifts; he made a lot of money by dint
of working about an hour a day and by the sheer force of
his personality. For the rest he played and played hard.
He talked; he ragged; he listened to music and saw
plays; he fell in love; he indulged harmless vices; and
he wrote two wonderful plays, full of faults, but streaked
with originality, with fire and with colour. In effect, he
could beat both Houghton and Brighouse at their own
game, and they knew it. But, at that time, playwriting
with Kahane was only a game; with the other two it was
deadly earnest.</p>

<p>Houghton and Brighouse were something (and, I
gathered, something not very brilliant) in the city.
Quite what that something was I do not know, though I
remember seeking out Brighouse once in a dark warehouse
smelling of damp cloth. Every afternoon Houghton and
Brighouse would close their ledgers, or petty-cash books,
or whatever it was they did close, and rush off home—Brighouse
to catch, perhaps, his six-five <span class="allsc">P.M.</span> train to Eccles,
and Houghton to jump gymnastically (he played hockey,
I believe) on to a passing tram bound for Alexandra Park.
After a hurried meal, out with the MSS., the notebooks,
the typescript and to work! And how hard they <em>did</em>
work!</p>

<p>I remember Brighouse telling me some years ago that
he had written more than thirty plays, but I cannot
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>conceive that anybody but himself has read them all.
Brighouse slogged, and he beat so long at the door of
success that at last it opened to him. Houghton also
slogged, but in a dandified way. He was clever, he was
cute, and he played his cards well.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Houghton was, not without full justice, called the leader
of the Manchester School of dramatists. He was hard;
he was unimaginative; he was unromantic. But he was
extraordinarily apt, and he had a neat and tidy brain.
Close must have been that union of souls that bound his
soul to the soul of Miss Horniman. Miss Horniman never
(well, hardly ever) produced a romantic play, and Stanley
Houghton never wrote one. He was out to “make
good,” and Miss Horniman helped him to go one
better.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say that Houghton was, so far as his
plays were concerned, an industrious man of business.
When the real artist has finished a work, he ceases to
take interest in it; but, with Houghton, when a play was
completed his interest in it immediately intensified. He
sent his plays everywhere: to the provinces, to London,
to America, to agents. As soon as a play came back,
“returned with thanks,” out it went again by the next
post. And he pulled strings—oh! ever so gently, but he
pulled them.</p>

<p>Though quite a few of his plays had been produced
in the north, and though he had written some clever
dramatic criticism for <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, he was
unknown in London till the Stage Society produced <cite>Hindle
Wakes</cite>. Then Fame came to him and knocked him off his
feet. It is impossible to imagine a man more conscious of
his success. His consciousness of it made him, on occasion,
tongue-tied. In conversation he could be ready,
and his repartee was frequently brilliant, but during the
years I knew him his attitude always suggested that he
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>anticipated and feared attack. I saw him once at the bar
of the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester, in the midst of a group
of friends. I was not of their company, but I noticed that
he stood silent, erect and strained, his head a little thrown
back, his face set. Then, and on many other occasions,
it seemed to me that he longed to break down the feeling
of awkwardness—to throw off the obsession of self-consciousness—that
overcame him.</p>

<p>But I must confess that I rarely saw him in company
in which there were not two or three who were hostile to
him; therefore I saw him but seldom at his best. Not
infrequently, there was a “dead set” against him, and if
the banter were edged with malice (as it not infrequently
was) he withered like a lily under the grip of a frost. The
truth is, he was not modest and he could not feign
modesty. His vanity was neither charming nor aggressive;
it was cold and distant, without geniality, without
humour. Genius is one of the wombs of vanity, but
Houghton had no genius; there was not a trace of magic
in him; he was merely extraordinarily clever, closely
observant and possessed of an instinctive sense of form
and of literary values.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>There came a day when it entered my head to interview
him for <cite>The Manchester Courier</cite>, a paper for which I wrote
musical criticism. He accepted my proposal with alacrity,
invited me to the Winter Garden of the Midland Hotel,
and provided me with coffee, liqueurs and cigars.</p>

<p>He began by telling me that this was the first time he
had been interviewed for the Press.</p>

<p>“An uncomfortable half-hour awaits you, then,” said
I, and, on the instant, he began to fidget.</p>

<p>I noticed that he was dressed for the occasion; he
looked prosperous and literary and there hung about him
just a suspicion of cosmopolitanism. Not only sartorially
was he prepared; his mind was in tune to the occasion
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and the right pose was donned. That is to say, he was
determined not to appear conceited or self-satisfied; but
he did not succeed. He made light of his success in a
heavy, emphatic way. He praised <cite>Hindle Wakes</cite> with
faint damns, and suggested that this play would soon
cease its successful run in London. He was careful not
to evince any pleasure in his success, any natural buoyancy
of spirit, any momentary delight. In a word, he was dull,
tactless and insincere. There was nothing boyish or
charming or graceful in his words; he had on all
his heavy armour and it banged and clanged as he
moved.</p>

<p>When the interview was over he invited me to his
father’s house for the evening meal. I went. I went out
of curiosity. He did not amuse me, but most certainly
he did interest me.</p>

<p>When we had finished our meal he took me to his study.
Near the window was a typewriter; in the typewriter
was a sheet of paper half covered with script. There
were very few erasures.</p>

<p>“I always compose straight on to the machine,” said
Houghton.</p>

<p>“Ah yes,” said I, “and so did J. M. Synge. It has
always seemed to me remarkable that Synge should do
that; in your own case, of course, it is not quite so
remarkable.”</p>

<p>“It is a comedy for Cyril Maude” (I think he said
Cyril Maude). “He wired to me the other day to go up
to London to see him. Yes; he wanted a comedy, and he
wanted me to write it. That was about a fortnight ago.
Well, the thing’s nearly finished; in another week it will
be on its way to London. Rather quick work, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“Quite. But all that you have told me I know already,
and, really, you must know that I know. You see, Brighouse
comes to the Swan Club day by day, drinks his
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beer—you know, the conventionally British pint he <em>will</em> have
in a pewter <span class="nw">mug——”</span></p>

<p>“Yes; Harold is very British,” interrupted Houghton.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he? Well, as I was saying, Brighouse drinks
his beer, fixes his eyes on his plate, and then spasmodically
tells us all the news about you. He told us, for example,
about Cyril Maude giving you a hundred (or was it a
thousand?) guineas for the sight of a new comedy; he
told us about <cite>The Daily Mail</cite> wanting articles from you at
some colossal figure; he told us about the host of people
who send you wires every day; he told us about——”<!-- TN: original has extraneous closing single quote --></p>

<p>Houghton stirred uneasily, but he looked intensely
gratified.</p>

<p>“He told us about everything,” I added, after a slight
pause. “What you tell him he tells us. But why don’t
you come and tell us yourself, Houghton? We never see
you at the Swan Club nowadays. It must not be said of
you that you desert old friends, that success has made you
careless of those you once liked.”</p>

<p>He darted a glance at me and decided, as was indeed
the case, that I was attempting to be ironical.</p>

<p>“The truth is,” said he, “that the company I find at
the Swan Club is not always very congenial. One or two
new men have been lately <span class="nw">introduced——”</span></p>

<p>He looked away from me meaningly.</p>

<p>“Quite,” said I, unperturbed; “oh, quite.”</p>

<p>“And,” he continued, “I am kept very busy with one
thing and another. It is true that I have given up my
business and now intend devoting all my energy to literary
work, but just at the present moment I am kept at it
from dawn to dusk.”</p>

<p>Silence fell upon us, a rather oppressive silence, I think,
for I remember hunting about in my mind for something
to say. I noticed a copy of <cite>The Playboy of the Western
World</cite> on the little table before us.</p>

<p>“Still reading Synge?” I asked.</p>

<p><a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Yes; still reading Synge,” he replied. Then, after a
pause: “A great man, Synge.”</p>

<p>“An interesting man, a curious man,” said I, “but
great? Only G. H. Mair, Willie Yeats and high school
girls think Synge great, Houghton.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked he languidly.</p>

<p>I invited him to have a cigarette, but he refused. In
truth, we were both very uncomfortable and, by the
subtle understanding and inverted sympathy that hearty
dislike engenders, we rose simultaneously to our feet,
rather hurriedly left the room, and soon found ourselves
in the hall downstairs. He opened the front door and we
stood for a moment, looking around us.</p>

<p>Next day my interview with Houghton appeared in
<cite>The Manchester Courier</cite>, with a portrait of the young
dramatist. I do not remember a word of that article,
but I am quite sure it was insincere, without distinction,
and full of inanities; indeed, I would bet at least ten
drachmæ that there occur in it such expressions as
“inherent modesty,” “charming personality,” “interesting
outlook on life,” and so on. A journalist (must I say
it?) is like a barrister: he is fee’d to say what is required
to be said. At all events, the interview pleased Houghton,
for he sent me a copy of <cite>Hindle Wakes</cite> with a jocular
inscription on its title-page.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>The friendship between Brighouse and Houghton increased
in intensity, and when Arnold Bennett publicly
referred to Brighouse in terms of no small admiration
Houghton decided that his eager disciple could be received
into the inner sanctum of his coldly fraternal
breast. And Brighouse, grateful to Bennett, loudly
proclaimed that <cite>Milestones</cite> was “the greatest play since
Congreve.”</p>

<p>“But why Congreve, Brighouse?” I asked. “Surely
you mean H. J. Byron?”</p>

<p><a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But no! He said he meant Congreve.</p>

<p>“I do not,” I said, considerably perturbed, “I do not
like to think, Brighouse, that you have stained your
virgin mind with Congreve.”</p>

<p>“I’ve looked at him,” said he icily. “He wrote
comedies. <cite>Milestones</cite> is a comedy.”</p>

<p>Now, I was used to Brighouse for, from the age of
eleven to thirteen I had been at the same school with him,
and I remembered how enormously sensitive and how self-contained
and how stubborn he was. I also remembered
that Rabelaisianism, or Congrevism, or, indeed, any ism
that denoted the real philosophic vulgarity of the human
mind, or any jolly indecent wit, was repellent to him.</p>

<p>“There are, I suppose, expurgated editions of Congreve,
Brighouse. I imagine you as a collector of expurgated
editions.”</p>

<p>But he buried his nose in his pint of beer and refused
further converse.</p>

<p>Now, such are the influences that one man may have
upon another, it came about that the more successful
Houghton became, the harder worked Brighouse. Said
Brighouse to himself, I imagine: “If Stanley can do all
this, why not I?” So he worked desperately, sloggingly,
overwhelmingly. Yet, in spite of all his hard work, he
kept a most watchful and jealous eye on his contemporaries,
and I remember meeting him at one of Miss
Horniman’s orgies at the Gaiety Theatre when a new play
of Galsworthy’s was given. It was a beautiful play
(Galsworthy has not written many beautiful plays), but I
regret to say I do not remember its name. At the end
of the first act Brighouse was disgustingly “superior,”
and at the end of the second he was contemptuous. So
I sought a quarrel with him. There are, I think, few
emotions so devastating, and so difficult to control, as
the anger that surges upon one when one hears a beautiful
work of art, noble, subtle and full of humanity, treated
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with contempt by a man whose vanity has blinded the
eyes of his soul. But I do not remember making any
attempt to control my anger at Brighouse; rather did
I nurse and nourish it, and, when the proper time came, I
poured it upon him with generosity. Harold—or “Brig,”
as we used to call him—is too much a man of the world
not to know how to deal with an excitable man in a
temper, and I remember coming away from our quarrel
feeling rather foolish and having a disturbing admiration
for Brighouse’s dignity. After this little episode, we
were always very polite to each other, and, later on, when
we met in London, our meeting was not without some
cordiality.</p>

<p>Since these days Brighouse has scored a big success
with <cite>Hobson’s Choice</cite>. He will score other successes. He
will die reputed and rich. He will live, some day, in a
West End flat and have a cottage in the country from
which he will issue at regular intervals and take long walks
in muddy lanes. I believe he will sedulously cultivate
the friendship of those who may be of service to him, and
he will drink his pint of beer every day of his life. He will
be praised twice a year by Sir William Robertson Nicoll.
Yes, he will be praised twice a year by Sir William
Robertson Nicoll. And when Sir William dies, Mr St John Adcock will take up the cry. And, when the war is
over, our successful young dramatist will go to America,
where the money comes from.... I should like to see
Harold in America.</p>

<p>There came a day when a new one-act play by Houghton
was given at the Manchester Gaiety—a play I subsequently
saw at a London music hall, its fit home; but I remember
neither the play’s title nor its plot. I recollect, however,
that three or four men and women met in the corridor of
a London hotel and talked or suggested risky things.
Rather stupid, I thought it, and it certainly never occurred
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to me that it was immoral or nasty; it was merely a
dramatic experiment that did not quite come off. But the
dramatic critic of <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>—either Mr A. N. Monkhouse or Mr C. E. Montague (I think the
former)—“went for” it tooth and nail on the score of
its alleged immorality. The criticism was scathing: it
made a wound and then poured acid into the wound.
Houghton must have felt the criticism sorely, but when
I met him next day he pluckily treated it as a matter of
no consequence whatever.</p>

<p>“A reasonable man cannot expect always to be understood,”
said he, “and I suppose <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>,
which has always been very good to me in the past, has
a right to scold me if it thinks fit.”</p>

<p>“A <em>scolding</em>, Houghton? Why, you were thrashed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose I was. But I can stand it.”</p>

<p>Vain men are invariably supersensitive, and for that
reason I think Houghton felt every word and act of
hostility; but he never showed weakness under opposition,
and he could hit back when he thought it worth
while.</p>

<p>I once witnessed a physical assault upon him after a
rather rowdy dinner, when we all took to ragging each
other. There was no excuse for the assault, except what
excuse may be found in bitter feeling and enmity, but
Houghton received the blow without a word, and we who
witnessed it neither expostulated with his assailant nor
expressed sympathy with his victim. Houghton paled
and his large eyes gleamed, and I have no doubt that on
a subsequent occasion he settled the matter with the man
who was responsible for his humiliation.</p>

<p>Only a very few men really understood Houghton, and
those were men who, like Walter Mudie, had known him
intimately in boyhood. Mudie swore by him and would
hear no word against him. But there was something forbidding
in Houghton’s nature—a barricade of reserve that
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he himself had not wilfully erected, but which had been
placed there by Nature. It was impossible for people
who met him casually a few times to form a high opinion
either of his intellect or of his personality. I remember
Captain James E. Agate, a most original and brilliant
colleague of Houghton’s on <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>,
once saying to a group of people: “Don’t you make any
mistake about Houghton. He’s not such a fool as he
appears.” But it is a very incomplete man who requires
such a double-edged defence as that.</p>

<p>Though the contrary has often been stated, Houghton
did not, I believe, take much interest in anybody’s work
except his own. He patronised a young bank clerk,
Charles Forrest, who had written a promising little play
that was subsequently, by Houghton’s recommendation,
I believe, given in Manchester and Liverpool; but when
he came in contact with work that was, in many respects,
superior to his own, he was airily superior and supercilious.
He once asked to see a blank-verse play of my own that
was given at the Manchester Gaiety, but as I was aware
that he knew as much of blank verse as I do of conic sections—which
is nothing at all—I refrained from passing
on my MS. to him. In other men’s work he looked for
faults; in his own he found perfection.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>I need scarcely say that when I went to London I did
not seek out Houghton, who had settled down in the
Metropolis some months before me. But we met in the
Strand, he wearing a fur-lined overcoat and looking a
trifle like H. B. Irving, and I carrying a load of review
books under my arm. We looked at each other; we
hesitated; we stopped. Stanley was a trifle languid and,
after a few inconsequent remarks, he began telling me the
history of his fur overcoat. He had, he said, bought it
for five pounds or seven pounds, or some such ridiculously
low price, and he had bought it second-hand.</p>

<p><a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>And (Fate wills these things) whenever I hear the name
Stanley Houghton I think of that rather tall, rather
aristocratic, figure in the Strand wearing its second-hand
fur-lined overcoat and talking, with embarrassment,
about nothing in particular, standing first on one foot and
then on the other.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to predict with certainty
what further successes Houghton would have achieved
had he lived, but there can be little doubt that his sharp
and lively talents would have produced plays even more
noticeable than <cite>Hindle Wakes</cite>. A little more experience of
life would probably have shown him the futility and the
destructive effects of his intellectual snobbery. He was
raw and crude, and success did not mellow or enlarge him.</p>

<p class="chapcontents"><small>Arnold Bennett—G. K. Chesterton—Lascelles Abercrombie—Harold
Monro—John Masefield—Jerome K. Jerome—Sir
Owen Seaman—A. A. Milne</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Of</span> all the famous writers I have met, I have found
Arnold Bennett the most surprising. I do not
know what kind of man I expected to see when
it was arranged that I should meet him, but I certainly
had not anticipated beholding the curiously, wrongly
dressed figure that, one spring afternoon some few years
ago, walked up the steps leading from the floor of Queen’s
Hall to the foyer of the gallery. I was there by appointment.
I was a friend of a friend of his—Havergal Brian,
a young fire-eating genius from the Potteries, and Brian
had planned this curious meeting. It was during the
interval of an afternoon concert of a Richard Strauss
Festival, and Ackté was singing.</p>

<p>Bennett was rather short, thin, hollow-eyed, prominent-toothed.
He wore a white waistcoat and a billycock hat
very much awry, and he had a manner of complete self-assurance.
I cannot say that I was unimpressed. We
were introduced, and he looked at me drowsily, indifferently,
insultingly indifferently. He did not speak and I,
nervous, and a little bewildered by the colour of his socks,
which I at that moment noticed for the first time, blundered
into some futility.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” said Bennett, in response.</p>

<p>I didn’t either, so far as that went. Desperately
uncomfortable, I looked round for Brian, and saw
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>him standing fifteen yards or so away, grinning
malignantly.</p>

<p>So I plunged into a new topic—with even more disastrous
results.</p>

<p>“I notice,” said I, “that you continue writing for <cite>The
New Age</cite> in spite of their violent attacks on you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered laconically, and he looked dizzily
over my left shoulder.</p>

<p>Then and there I decided that I would not speak again
until he had spoken. I had not sought the interview any
more than he had. Presently:</p>

<p>“I have been working very hard lately,” I heard. I
turned quickly to him; he had spoken into space. I
showed a polite interest and he thawed a little. He told
me something of the number of words and hours he
wrote a day, of the work he had planned for the next two
years, of the regularity of his methods, of his disbelief
in the value of “inspiration.” I seemed to have heard it
all before about Anthony Trollope. He was not exactly
loquacious, but he communicated a great deal in spite of
a rather unpleasant impediment in his <span class="nw">speech....</span></p>

<p>Soon our interview was over, for we heard the orchestra
tuning up, and we left each other with just a word of
farewell and without a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>His conversational powers never, I believe, reach the
point of eloquence. I remember G. H. Mair giving me an
amusing description of a breakfast he gave to Arnold
Bennett and Stanley Houghton in his lodgings in Manchester.
Bennett and Houghton had not previously met,
and the latter was young and inexperienced enough to
nurse the expectation that the personality of the famous
writer would be as impressive as his work, and impressive
in the same way. It is true that very extraordinary circumstances
would be necessary to make breakfast in
Manchester free from dullness, but Houghton no doubt
thought that his meeting with Bennett <em>was</em> an
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>extraordinary circumstance. In the event, however, he was
disillusioned.</p>

<p>They went in to breakfast, and Bennett sat moody and
silent, crumbling a piece of bread. It chanced that on
being admitted to the house Bennett had caught sight
of a cabman carrying a particularly large trunk downstairs,
and he began to question Mair closely about
the incident, Mair explaining that a fellow-lodger was
removing that morning and taking all his luggage
with him.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Bennett, a little impatiently, “but
why should he have such a large trunk? It was enormous.
I don’t think I have ever seen so large a trunk
before. It was at least twice the usual size.”</p>

<p>He took a mouthful of bacon and spent a minute in
mastication. Having swallowed:</p>

<p>“Absurdly large,” he said challengingly. “I can’t
think why anyone should wish to own it. Besides, it’s
not right to ask any man to carry such an enormous
weight. That’s how strangulated hernia is caused. Yes,
strangulated hernia.”</p>

<p>The topic did not prove fruitful, and I can imagine
Houghton cudgelling his brains to discover what strangulated
hernia really was, and Mair saying something
witty about it. But with his second cup of coffee and
his marmalade and toast Bennett once more talked of
the cabman, the impossible trunk, and the cabman’s
hypothetical hernia.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he remarked meditatively, “the man
must have <em>some</em> reason for owning such an incredibly large
trunk, but I confess I can’t guess the reason. And, in any
case, it is bound to be a selfish one. Now, strangulated
<span class="nw">hernia——”</span></p>

<p>And that was all that issued during a whole hour from
one of the cleverest brains in England.</p>

<p>That Arnold Bennett is almost painfully conscious of
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his own cleverness there is no manner of doubt. He is
stupendously aware of the figure he cuts in contemporary
literature. He is for ever standing outside himself and
enjoying the spectacle of his own greatness, and he whispers
ten times a day: “Oh, what a great boy am I!” I
was once shown a series of privately printed booklets
written by Bennett—booklets that he sent to his intimates
at Christmas time. They consisted of extracts from his
diary—a diary that, one feels, would never have been
written if the de Goncourts had not lived. One self-conscious
extract lingers in the mind; the spirit of it,
though not the words (and perhaps not the facts) is
embodied in the following:—“It is 3 <span class="allsc">A.M.</span> I have
been working fourteen hours at a stretch. In these
fourteen hours I have written ten thousand words. My
book is finished—finished in excitement, in exaltation.
Surely not even Balzac went one better than this!”</p>

<p>A great writer: no doubt, a very great writer: but
you might gaze at him across a railway carriage for hours
at a time and never suspect it.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>But if Arnold Bennett is the least picturesque and
literary of figures, G. K. Chesterton is the most picturesque
and literary. His mere bulk is impressive. On one
occasion I saw him emerge from Shoe Lane, hurry into the
middle of Fleet Street, and abruptly come to a standstill
in the centre of the traffic. He stood there for some time,
wrapped in thought, while buses, taxis and lorries eddied
about him in a whirlpool and while drivers exercised to
the full their gentle art of expostulation. Having come
to the end of his meditations he held up his hand, turned
round, cleared a passage through the horses and vehicles
and returned up Shoe Lane. It was just as though he had
deliberately chosen the middle of Fleet Street as the most
fruitful place for thought. Nobody else in London could
have done it with his air of absolute unconsciousness, of
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>absent-mindedness. And not even the most stalwart
policeman, vested with full authority, could have dammed
up London’s stream of traffic more effectively.</p>

<p>The more one sees of Chesterton the more difficult it is to
discover when he is asleep and when he is awake. He may
be talking to you most vivaciously one moment, and the
next he will have disappeared: his body will be there, of
course, but his mind, his soul, the living spirit within him,
will have sunk out of sight.</p>

<p>One Friday afternoon I went to <cite>The Daily Herald</cite> office
to call on a friend. As I entered the building a taxi
stopped at the door and I found G. K. C. by my side.</p>

<p>“I have half-an-hour for my article,” said he, rather
breathlessly. “Wait here till I come back.”</p>

<p>The first sentence was addressed to himself, the second
to the taxi-driver, but as we were by now in the office the
driver heard nothing. Chesterton called for a back file of
<cite>The Daily Herald</cite>, sat down, lit a cigar and began to read
some of his old articles. I watched him. Presently, he
smiled. Then he laughed. Then he leaned back in his
chair and roared. “Good—oh, damned good!” exclaimed
he. He turned to another article and frowned a
little, but a third pleased him better. After a while he
pushed the papers from him and sat a while in thought.
“And as in uffish thought he” sat, he wrote his article,
rapidly, calmly, drowsily. Save that his hand moved,
he might have been asleep. Nothing disturbed him—neither
the noise of the office nor the faint throb of his
taxi-cab rapidly ticking off twopences in the street below....
He finished his article and rolled dreamily away.</p>

<p>His brother Cecil has the same gift of detachment. He
can write anywhere and under any conditions. I have
seen him order a mixed grill at the Gambrinus in Regent
Street, begin an article before his food was served, and continue
writing for an hour while the dishes were placed
before him and allowed to go stone cold. Like most men
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in Fleet Street who do a tremendous amount of work, he
has always plenty of time for play, and I do not remember
ever to have come across him when he was not ready and
willing to spend a half-hour in chat in one of the thousand
and one little caravanserai that lurk so handily in the
Strand and Fleet Street.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Of poets of the younger generation I have met only
three—Lascelles Abercrombie, Harold Monro, and John
Masefield. Abercrombie I remember as a lean, spectacled
man, who used to come to Manchester occasionally to hear
music and, I think, to converse intellectually with Miss
Horniman. Of music he had a sane and temperate
appreciation, but was too prone to condemn modern
work, of which, by the way, he knew nothing and which
by temperament he was incapable of understanding. He
struck me as cold and daring—cold, daring and a little
calculating. He appeared unexpectedly one day at my
house, stayed for lunch, talked all afternoon, and went
away in the evening, leaving me a little bewildered by the
things he had refrained from saying. Really, we had
nothing in common. My personality could not touch his
genius at any point, and the things he wished to discuss—the
technicalities of his craft, philosophy, æsthetics and
so on—have no interest for me. If I had not studied his
work and admired it whole-heartedly<!-- TN: hyphen added for consistency -->, I should have come
to the conclusion that he had written poetry through sheer
cleverness and brightness of brain. No man was less of a
poet in appearance and conversation. He professed at all
times a huge liking for beer, but I never saw him drink
more than a modest pint, and his pose of “muscular
poet” (a school founded and fed by Hilaire Belloc)
deceived few.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Harold Monro I used to see occasionally in the Café
Royal, and I met him a few times at the Crab Tree Club.
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I remember going with him, early one morning in June,
1914, after sitting up all night, to the Turkish baths in
Jermyn Street. We swam a little in a tank and were then
conducted to a cubicle, where I wished to talk, but Monro
was heavy with sleep and soon began to breathe stertorously.
A few days later he received me rather heavily
at his office at The Poetry Bookshop, read some of my
verses, and told me quite frankly that he did not consider
me much of a poet. A sound, solid man, Monro,
and he has written at least one poem—<cite>Trees</cite>—as
delicate and as beautiful as anything done in our time.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>But neither Monro nor Abercrombie, greatly gifted and
earnest in their work though they be, fulfils one’s conception
of a poetic personality. There is no mystery about
them, no glamour; they do not arouse wonder or surprise.
John Masefield, on the other hand, has an invincible
picturesqueness—a picturesqueness that stamps him at
once as different from his fellows. He is tall, straight
and blue-eyed, with a complexion as clear as a child’s.
His eyes are amazingly shy, almost furtive. His manner
is shy, almost furtive. He speaks to you as though he
suspected you of hostility, as though you had the power
to injure him and were on the point of using that power.
You feel his sensitiveness and you admire the dignity that
is at once its outcome and its protection.</p>

<p>There are many legends about Masefield; he is the
kind of figure that gives rise to legends. And, as he is
curiously reticent about his early life, some of the most
extravagant of these legends have persisted and have, for
many people, become true. But the bare facts of his life
are interesting enough. As a young man he grew sick of
life, of the kind of life he was living, and went to sea as
a sailor before the mast. He had neither money nor
friends; or, if he had, he relinquished both. The necessity
to earn a living drove him into many adventures, and
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I am told that for a time he was pot-boy in a New York
drink-den. Here his work must have been utterly distasteful,
but the observing eye and the impressionable
brain of the poet were at work the whole time, and one
can see clearly in some of Masefield’s long narrative
poems many evidences of those bitter New York days.
How Masefield came to London and settled in Bloomsbury,
becoming the friend of J. M. Synge, I do not know.
For six months he was in Manchester, editing the column
entitled Miscellany in <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, and
writing occasional theatrical notices. I have been told
by several of his colleagues on that paper that Masefield’s
reserve was invulnerable; he quickly secured the respect
of his fellow-workers, but not one of them became intimate
with him. He lived in dingy lodgings, he worked hard and,
at the end of six months, withdrew to London on the plea
that he found it impossible to do literary work at night.</p>

<p>But if the circumstances of Masefield’s life are little
known, his spiritual history is more than indicated in his
work. Here one sees a stricken soul; a nature wounded
and a little poisoned; a nervous system agitated and
apprehensive. His mind is cast in a tragic mould and
his soul takes delight in the contemplation of physical
violence. His personality, as I have said, is furtive. He
shrinks. His intimate friends may have heard him
laugh. I have not.</p>

<p>It must be nearly six years since I visited him at his
house in Well Walk, Hampstead. It was a miserably
cold afternoon in February, and though it was not yet
twilight the blinds of the drawing-room were drawn and
the lights already lit. Masefield’s conversation was intolerably
cautious, intolerably shy. In a rather academic
way he deplored the lack of literary critics in England;
the art of criticism was dead; the essay was moribund.
He expanded this theme perfunctorily, walking up and
down the room slowly and never looking me in the eyes
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>once. It was only when, at length, he had sat down—not
opposite me, but with the side of his face towards me—that,
very occasionally, his eyes would seek mine with a
rapid dart and turn away instantly, and at such moments
it seemed as though he almost winced. Such shrinking,
such excessive timidity, whilst arousing my curiosity, also
made me feel no little discomfort, and I was glad when a
spirit kettle was brought in, with cups and saucers, and
Masefield began to make tea.</p>

<p>This making of tea, a most solemn business, reminded
me of <cite>Cranford</cite>. The poet walked to a corner of the room,
took therefrom a long narrow box divided into a number
of compartments and proceeded, most delicately, to
measure out and mix two or three different kinds of tea.
The teapot was next heated, the blended tea thrown in,
and boiling water immediately poured on it. And then
the tea was timed, Masefield holding his watch in his hand
and pouring out the fluid into the cups at the psychological
second.... He ought, I think, to have taken a little
silver key from his waistcoat pocket and locked up the tea-box.
He ought to have taken his knitting from a work-box.
He ought to have asked me if I had yet spoken to
the new curate. But he did none of these <span class="nw">things....</span></p>

<p>Though for an hour he continued talking, he said
nothing—at least, he said nothing I have remembered.
The extraordinary thing about him was that, in spite of
his timidity, his seeming apprehensiveness, he left on my
mind a deep impression of adventure—not of a man who
sought physical, but spiritual, risks. I think he is a poet
who cannot refrain from exacerbating his own soul, who
must at all costs place his mind in danger and escape only
at the last moment. I believe he is intensely morbid,
delighting to brood over dark things, seeing no humour
in life, but full of a baffled chivalry, a nobility thwarted at
every turn.</p>

 /></span></span></a>A man of a very different type is Jerome K. Jerome,
whom I met at the National Liberal Club and elsewhere
in the early days of the war. Like all humorists, he is
an inveterate sentimentalist; his belief in human nature
is as wide-eyed and innocent as that of a child. He is an
untidy, prosperous, middle-aged man—very kindly, but
a little intolerant. His mental attitude is that of a man
sitting a little apart from life, alternately amused and
saddened by the things he sees. In the drawing-room of
his flat at Chelsea he seemed a little out of place; he did
not harmonise with his surroundings. But in the Club he
was easy, natural, at home. More than twenty years ago
I heard him lecture in Manchester; the Jerome of to-day
is the Jerome of those far-off years, a little mellower
perhaps, a little quieter, a little more sentimental, but
essentially the same in appearance, in manner and in his
attitude towards life.</p>

<p>I have met other humorists, but of a type very different
from that represented by Jerome. Sir Owen Seaman
I met at a little dinner given by the Critics’ Circle at
Gatti’s to a colleague of ours who was on the point of
leaving for the Front, and who, alas! is now no more.
Sir Owen was made both by nature and training for a
squarson—that useful but fast-dying gentleman who combines
the duties and responsibilities of squire and parson.
His personality, rather beefy and John Bullish, confirms
one’s expectations. He made an excellent chairman at
this particular dinner.</p>

<p>His very brilliant assistant, A. A. Milne, I once interviewed
for a now defunct Labour paper. I was invited
to the office of <cite>Punch</cite>, and met a tall, slim, yellow-haired
and blue-eyed youth, who was so inordinately shy that,
after half-an-hour’s perfunctory conversation, I discovered
that I had not sufficient material for a paragraph,
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whereas I had orders to make a column article of the interview.
I knew instinctively that Milne must find, as I do,
a good deal in W. S. Gilbert’s writings that is in deplorable
taste, and I did my utmost to induce him to say something
very rude about Sullivan’s collaborator. But he would
not “bite.” He nodded and smiled at, and appeared to
agree with, all the savage things I said of Gilbert, but he
would say very little—and certainly not enough for my
purpose—on his own account. I tried other subjects,
but without success; finally, I got up in despair, thanked
him for the time he had given me and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>“But,” said Milne, eyeing me, a little distrustfully, “I
must see a copy of your article before it is printed.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said I, and that evening posted it
to him, expecting to see it back with perhaps one or two
minor alterations.</p>

<p>But when my poor article arrived back (really, I thought
it an excellent piece of work) I could scarcely recognise it,
so heavily was it scored out, so numerous were the alterations.
And Milne’s accompanying letter was scathing.
I remember one or two sentences. “I cannot tell you
how thankful I am,” he wrote, “that I insisted on seeing
your article before it was printed. It does not represent
my views in the least; your talent for misrepresentation
is remarkably resourceful.”</p>

<p>When the article was finally passed for publication at
least seventy-five per cent. of it was from Milne’s pen.
He wrote one or two other stabbing sentences to me, from
which it appeared that, however numerous his virtues may
be, he is unable to suffer fools gladly.</p>

 />SIR EDWARD ELGAR</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">The</span> weaknesses that seem to be inseparable from
genius—and, most particularly, from artistic
genius—are precisely those one would not expect
to discover associated with greatness of mind. It would
appear that few men are so great as their work, or, if they
are, their greatness is spasmodic and evanescent. Works
of genius, it is sometimes stated, are created in moods of
exaltation, when the spirit is in turmoil, when the mind is
lit and the nerves are tense. In some cases it may be so.
It was so, I believe, in the case of Wagner, who had long
spells, measured by years, of unproductiveness, when his
creative powers lay fallow; and it was so in the case of
Hugo Wolf, Beethoven, Shelley, Poe, Berlioz and many
other men whose names spring to the mind. But it
certainly was not so with Balzac and Dickens, any more
than it is to-day with Arnold Bennett.</p>

<p>There is in Sir Edward Elgar’s work a strange contradiction:
great depth of understanding combined with a
curious fastidiousness of style that is almost finicking.
Many aspects of life appeal to his sympathies and to his
imagination, but an innate and exaggerated delicacy, an
almost feminine shrinking, is noticeable in even his strongest
and most outspoken work.... It is this delicacy, this
shrinking, that to the casual acquaintance is at once his
most conspicuous and most teasing characteristic.</p>

<p>My first meeting with Elgar was ten years ago, when,
being commissioned to interview him for a monthly
musical magazine, I called on him at the Midland Hotel,
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Manchester, where he was staying for a night. On my
way to his room I met him in the corridor, where he
carefully explained that he had made it a strict rule never
to be interviewed for the Press and that under no circumstances
could that rule be broken. His firm words were
spoken with hesitation, and it was quite obvious to me
that he was feeling more than a trifle nervous. I have
little doubt that this nervousness was due to the fact that
in an hour’s time he was to conduct a concert at the Free
Trade Hall. However, he was kind enough to loiter for
some minutes and talk, but he took care, when I left him,
to remind me that nothing of what he had said to me must
appear in print.</p>

<p>I, of course, obeyed him, but, in place of an interview,
I wrote an impressionistic sketch of the man as I had
seen him during my few minutes’ conversation at the
Midland Hotel. Of this impressionistic sketch I remember
nothing except that, in describing his general bearing and
manner, I used the word “aristocratic.” At this word
Elgar rose like a fat trout eager to swallow a floating fly.
It confirmed his own hopes. And I who had perceived this
quality so speedily, so unerringly, and who had proclaimed
it to the world, was worthy of reward. Yes; he would
consent to be interviewed. The ban should be lifted; for
once the rule should be broken. A letter came inviting
me to Plas Gwyn, Hereford—a letter written by his wife
and full of charming compliments about my article.</p>

<p>So to Hereford I went and talked music and chemistry.
It was Christmas week, and within ten minutes of my
arrival Lady Elgar was giving me hot dishes, wine and her
views on the political situation. The country was in the
throes of a General Election, and while I ate and drank I
heard how the Empire was, as Dr Kendrick Pyne used to
say, “rushing headlong to the bow-wows.” Lady Elgar
did not seem to wish to know to what particular party (if
any) I belonged, but I quickly discovered that to confess
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>myself a Radical would be to arouse feelings of hostility
in her bosom. Radicals were the Unspeakable People.
There was not one, I gathered, in Hereford. They
appeared to infest Lancashire, and some had been heard
of in Wales. Also, there were people called Nonconformists.
Many persons were Radicals, many
Nonconformists; but some were both. The Radicals
had won several seats. What was the country coming
to? Where was the country going?</p>

<p>Where, indeed? I did not allow Lady Elgar’s rather
violent political prejudices to interfere with my appetite,
and she appeared to be perfectly satisfied with an occasional
sudden lift of my eyebrows, and such ejaculations
as: “Oh, quite! Quite!” “Most assuredly!” and
“Incredible!” If she thought about me at all—and I
am persuaded she did not—she must have believed me
also to be a Tory. After all, had not I called her husband
“aristocratic,” and is that the sort of word used by a
Radical save in contempt?</p>

<p>After lunch Elgar took me a quick walk along the river-bank.
For the first half-hour I found him rather reserved
and non-committal, and I soon recognised that if I were to
succeed in obtaining his views on any matter of interest
I must rigidly abstain from direct questions. But when
he did commit himself to any opinion, he did so in the
manner of one who is sure of his own ground and cannot
consider, even temporarily, any change in the attitude he
has already assumed.</p>

<p>I found his views on musical critics amusing, but before
proceeding to set them down I must make some reference
to his relations with Ernest Newman. Newman, it is
generally agreed, is unquestionably the most brilliant,
the fairest-minded and the most courageous writer on
music in England. His power is very great, and he has
done more to educate public opinion on musical matters
in England than any other man. For some little period
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>previous to the time of which I am writing he and Elgar
had been close friends, and their friendship was all the
stronger because it rested on the attraction of opposites.
Elgar was an ardent Catholic, a Conservative; Newman
was an uncompromising free-thinker and a Radical. Elgar
was a pet of society, a man careful and even snobbish in
his choice of his friends, whilst Newman cared nothing for
society and would be friendly with any man who interested
or amused him.</p>

<p>Up to the time Elgar composed <cite>The Apostles</cite> he had no
more whole-hearted admirer than Newman, but this work
was to sever their friendship and, for a time, to bring
bitterness where before there had been esteem and even
affection. Newman was invited by a New York paper—I
think <cite>The Musical Courier</cite>—to write at considerable length
on <cite>The Apostles</cite>. As his opinion of this work was, on the
whole, unfavourable, he may possibly have hesitated to
consider an invitation the acceptance of which would lead
to his giving pain to a friend. But probably Newman
thought, as most inflexibly honest men would think,
that, on a matter of public concern, silence would be
cowardly. In the event, he wrote his article and sent it to
America, also forwarding a copy to Elgar himself, telling
him that, though it went against his feelings of friendship
to condemn the work, he thought it a matter of duty to
speak what was in his mind. That letter and that
article severed their friendship, and the severance lasted
for some considerable time.</p>

<p>My visit to Elgar took place during his estrangement
from Newman, and when I mentioned the subject of
musical criticism to him it was, I imagine, with the hope
that the name of the famous critic would crop up. It did.</p>

<p>“The worst of musical criticism in this country,” said
Elgar, “is that there is so much of it and so little that is
serviceable. Most of those who are skilled musicians
either have not the gift of criticism or they cannot express
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>their ideas in writing, and most of those who can write
are deplorably deficient in their knowledge of music. For
myself I never read criticism of my own work; it simply
does not interest me. When I have composed or published
a work, my interest in it wanes and dies; it belongs
to the public. What the professional critics think of it
does not concern me in the least.”</p>

<p>Though I knew that Elgar had on previous occasions
given expression to similar views, his statement amazed
me. So I pressed him a little.</p>

<p>“But suppose,” I urged, “a new work of yours were so
universally condemned by the critics that performances
of it ceased to take place. Would you not then read their
criticisms in order to discover if there was not some truth
in their statements?”</p>

<p>“It is possible, but I do not think I should. But your
supposition is an inconceivable one: there is never
universal agreement among musical critics. I think you
will notice that many of them are, from the æsthetic point
of view, absolutely devoid of principle; I mean, they are
victims of their own temperaments. They, as the schoolgirl
says, ‘know what they like.’ The music they condemn
is either the music that does not appeal to their
particular kind of nervous system or it is the music they
do not understand. They have no standard, no norm, no
historical sense, <span class="nw">no——”</span></p>

<p>He stammered a little and waved a vague arm in the air.</p>

<p>“There are exceptions, of course,” I ventured. “Newman,
for example.”</p>

<p>“No; Ernest Newman is not altogether an exception.
He is an unbeliever, and therefore cannot understand
religious music—music that is at once reverential, mystical
and devout.”</p>

<p>“‘Devout’?” whispered I to myself. Aloud I said:</p>

<p>“A man’s reason, I think, may reject a religion, though
his emotional nature may be susceptible to its slightest
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>appeal. Besides, Newman has a most profound admiration
for your <cite>The Dream of Gerontius</cite>.”</p>

<p>Elgar was silent for a few minutes. Then, with an
air of detachment and with great inconsequence, he
said:</p>

<p>“Baughan, of <cite>The Daily News</cite>, cannot hum a melody
correctly in tune. He looks at music from the point of
view of a man of letters. So does Newman, fine musician
though he is. Newman advocates programme music.
Now, I do not say that programme music should not be
written, for I have composed programme music myself.
But I do maintain that it is a lower form of art than
absolute music. Newman, I believe, refuses to acknowledge
that either kind is necessarily higher or lower than
the other. He has, as I have said, the literary man’s
point of view about music. So have many musical
critics.”</p>

<p>“And so,” I interpolated, “if one has to accept what
you say as correct, have many composers, and composers
also who are not specifically literary. And, after what you
have said, I find that strange. Take the case of Richard
Strauss, all of whose later symphonic poems have a programme,
a literary basis. Do you, for that reason, declare
that Strauss regards music from the literary man’s point
of view—Strauss who, of all living musicians, is the
greatest?”</p>

<p>He paused for a few moments, and it seemed to me that
our pace quickened as we left the bank of the river and
made for a pathway across a meadow. But he would not
take up the argument; stammering a little, he said:</p>

<p>“Richard Strauss is a very great man—a fine fellow.”</p>

<p>But as that was not the point under discussion, I felt
that either his mind was wandering or that he could think
of no reply to my objection.</p>

<p>A little later, on our way home, we discussed the
younger generation of composers, and I found him very
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>appreciative of the work done by his juniors. He particularly
mentioned Havergal Brian, a composer who has
more than justified what Elgar prophesied of him, though
perhaps not in the manner Elgar anticipated.</p>

<p>Apropos of something or other, Elgar said, I think quite
needlessly and a little vainly:</p>

<p>“You must not, as many people appear to do, imagine
that I am a musician and nothing else. I am many things;
I find time for many things. Do not picture me always
bending over manuscript paper and writing down notes;
months pass at frequent intervals when I write nothing at
all. At present I am making a study of chemistry.”</p>

<p>I think I was expected to look surprised, or to give vent
to an exclamation of surprise, but I did neither, for I also
had made a study of chemistry, and it seemed to me the
kind of work that any man of inquiring mind might take
up. I did not for one moment imagine that I was living
in the first half of the nineteenth century when practically
all British musicians were musicians and nothing else and
not always even musicians.</p>

<p>When we had returned to the house we sat before a
large fire and, under the soothing influence of warmth and
semi-darkness, stopped all argument. In the evening
Lady Elgar accompanied me to the station, and all the
way from Hereford to Manchester I turned over in my
mind the strange problem that was presented to me by the
fact that, though I was a passionate, almost fanatical
lover of Elgar’s music, the creator of that music attracted
me not at all. I saw in his mind a daintiness that was
irritating, a refinement that was distressingly self-conscious.</p>

<p>Some years later Sir Edward Elgar moved to London,
and when I saw him in his new home he tried to prove to
me that living in London was cheaper than living in the
country.</p>

<p>His attitude towards me on this occasion was peculiarly
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>strange. I represented a Labour paper, but Elgar did not
know that I was at the same time writing leading articles
for a London Conservative daily. He treated me with
the most careful kindness, a kindness so careful, indeed,
that it might be called patronising. It soon became quite
clear to me that he imagined I myself came from the
labouring classes, but I cannot boast that honour, and as
he, the aristocrat, was in contact with me, the plebeian,
it was his manifest duty and his undoubted pleasure to
help me along the upward path. I was advised to read
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare,” said he, “frees the mind. You, as
a journalist, will find him useful in so far as a close study
of his works will purify your style and enlarge your
vocabulary.”</p>

<p>“Which of the plays would you advise me to read?”
asked I, with simulated innocence and playing up to him
with eyes and voice.</p>

<p>The astounding man considered a minute and then
mentioned half-a-dozen plays, the titles of which I carefully
wrote down in my pocket-book.</p>

<p>“And Ruskin,” he added as an afterthought. “Oh,
yes, and Cardinal Newman. Newman’s style is perhaps
the purest style of any man who wrote in the nineteenth
century.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” said I, thoroughly roused and forgetting
to play my part. “The <cite>Apologia</cite> is slipshod. My
own style, faulty though it may be, is more correct, more
lucid, even more distinguished than Cardinal Newman’s.”</p>

<p>He turned away, either angry or amused.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said I, with warmth. “Anyone who has
tried for years, as I have done, to master the art of writing,
and who examines the <cite>Apologia</cite> carefully will perceive at
once that it is shamefully badly written. For two generations
it has been the fashion to praise Newman’s style, but
those who have done so have never read him in a critical
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>spirit. I would infinitely prefer to have written a racy
book like—well, like <cite>Moll Flanders</cite>, where the English is
beautifully clean and strong, than the sloppy <cite>Apologia</cite>.”</p>

<p>“<cite>Moll Flanders</cite>,” he said questioningly; “<cite>Moll
Flanders</cite>? I do not know the book.”</p>

<p>“It is all about a whore,” said I brutally, “written by
one Defoe.”</p>

<p>And that, of course, put an end to our conversation. I
rose to leave.</p>

<p>The impression left on my mind by my two visits to
Elgar is definite enough, but I am willing to believe
that it does not represent the man as he truly is. He is
abnormally sensitive, abnormally observant, abnormally
intuitive. Like almost all men, he is open to flattery, but
the flattery must be applied by means of hints, praise
half veiled, innuendo. If you gush he will freeze; if you
praise directly, he will wince. His mind is essentially
narrow, for he shrinks from the phenomena in life that
hurt him and he will not force himself to understand
alien things. His intellect is continually rejecting the
very matters that, in order to gain largeness, tolerance
and a full view of life, it should understand and accept.
Yet, within its narrow confines, his brain functions most
rapidly and with a clear light.</p>

<p>I have been told by members of the various orchestras
he has conducted that when interpreting a work like <cite>The
Dream of Gerontius</cite> his face is wet with tears.</p>

<p>He has a proper sense of his own dignity, and it is
doubtful if he exaggerates the importance of his own
powers. Many years ago, as I have related, I employed
the word “aristocrat” in describing him, and to-day I
feel that that word must stand. He has all the strength
of the aristocrat and many of the aristocrat’s weaknesses.</p>

 />INTELLECTUAL FREAKS</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">In</span> the most tragic and most trying moments of life it
is well to turn aside from one’s sorrows and refresh
one’s mind and strengthen one’s soul by gazing upon
the follies of others. Those others gaze on ours.</p>

<p>In my spiritual adventures I have met many amazingly
freakish people. Ten years ago the Theosophical Society
overflowed with them. They were cultured without
being educated, credulous but without faith, bookish but
without learning, argumentative but without logic. The
women, serene and grave, swam about in drawing-rooms,
or they would stand in long, attitudinising ecstasies, their
skimpy necks emerging from strange gowns, their bodies
as shoulderless as hock bottles. The men paddled about
in the same rooms, but I found them less amusing than the
women.</p>

<p>“You were a horse in your last incarnation,” said a
fuzzy-haired giantess to me one evening, two minutes after
we had been introduced.</p>

<p>“Oh, how disappointing!” I exclaimed. “I had
always imagined myself an owl. I often dream I was an
owl. I fly about, you know, or sit on branches with my
eyes shut.”</p>

<p>“No; a horse!” shouted the giantess, with much asperity.
“I’m not arguing with you. I’m merely telling you.
And I don’t think you were a very nice horse either.”</p>

<p>“No? Did I bite people?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you bit and kicked. And you did other disagreeable
things besides. Now, <em>I</em> was a swan.”</p>

<p><a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>I evinced a polite but not enthusiastic interest.</p>

<p>“You would make an imposing swan,” I observed.</p>

<p>“Yes. I used to glide about on ponds, like this.”</p>

<p>She proceeded to “glide” round and round the corner
of the room in which we were sitting. She arched her
neck, raised her ponderous legs laboriously and moved
about like a pantechnicon. Her face assumed a disagreeable
expression and I thought of a rather good line in one
of my own poems:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div>And swans sulked largely on the yellow mere.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And how much of your previous incarnation do you
remember?” I asked, when she had finished sulking
largely in the yellow drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite a lot. It comes back to me in flashes. I
was very lonely—oh, <em>so</em> lonely.”</p>

<p>She gave me a quick look, and I began to talk of William
J. Locke, who, a few days previously, had published a
new book. Resenting my change of subject, she left
me and, a few minutes later, as I was eating a watercress
sandwich, I heard her saying to a yellow-haired
male:</p>

<p>“You were a horse in your last incarnation.”</p>

<p>I met this lady on other occasions, and always she was
occupied in telling men that they had been horses and she
a swan—an oh-so-lonely swan.</p>

<p>“Why,” said I to my hostess one day, “don’t Madame
X.’s friends look after her? See—she is arching her neck
over there in the corner, and I am perfectly certain she has
told the man with her that he has been, is, or is going to be
a horse.”</p>

<p>For a moment my hostess looked concerned.</p>

<p>“Look after her? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, she is obviously insane.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, she is the most subtle exponent we
have of Madame Blavatsky’s <cite>Secret Doctrine</cite>. Eccentric,
<a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>perhaps, but as lucid a brain as Mr G. R. S. Mead’s or as
Colonel Olcott’s. You should get her to describe your
aura. She is excellent, too, in Plato. She doesn’t understand
a word of Greek, but she gets at his meaning
intuitively. There is something cosmic about her. <em>You</em>
know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite, quite.” (But what <em>did</em> she mean?)</p>

<p>“Cosmic consciousness is a most enthralling subject,”
continued my hostess, digging the hockey-stick she always
carried with her well into the hearthrug. “Walt Whitman
had it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Badly?” I inquired.</p>

<p>She appeared puzzled.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know what you mean by ‘badly.’ He
could identify himself with anything—the wind, a stone,
a jelly-fish, an arm-chair, a ... a ... oh, everything!
They were he and he was they. He <em>thought</em> cosmically.
Fourth dimension, you know. Edward Carpenter and all
that.”</p>

<p>I rather admired this way she had of talking—a little
like the Duke in G. K. Chesterton’s <cite>Magic</cite>.</p>

<p>“Oh, do go on!” I urged her.</p>

<p>“What I always say is,” she continued, “why stop at
a fourth dimension? Someone has written a book on the
fourth dimension, and some day perhaps I shall write one
on the fifth.”</p>

<p>“A book? A real book? Do you mean to say you
could write a book? How clever! How romantic!”</p>

<p>“Well, I have thought about it. One is influenced.
One has influences. The consciousness of the ultimate
truth of things, the truth that suffuses all things, the
cosmic nature of—well, the cosmos. Do you see?
Tennyson’s <cite>In Memoriam</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Tennyson’s <cite>In Memoriam</cite> does help, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Did I say Tennyson’s <cite>In Memoriam</cite>? I really meant
<a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Shelley’s <cite>Revolt of Islam</cite>. The fourth dimension is played
out. It’s done with. It was true so far as it went, but
how far did it go?”</p>

<p>“Only a very little way,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Nietzsche goes much farther. Have you
read Nietzsche? No? I haven’t, either. But I have
heard Orage talk about him. Nietzsche says we can all
do what we want. We must dare things. We must be
blond beasts. Mary Wollstonecraft and her set, you know.
Godwin and those people.”</p>

<p>She waved her hockey-stick recklessly in the air and
marched inconsequently away. Nearly all the Theosophists
I met were like that—inconsequent, bent on writing
books they never did write, talkers of divine flapdoodle,
inanely clever, cleverly inane. Dear freaks I used to meet
in days gone by!—where are you now?—where are you
now?</p>

<p>A freak who ultimately lost all reason and was confined
in a private asylum used to sit at the same desk that I did
when, many years ago, I was a shipping clerk in Manchester.
This man, whose name was not, but should have
been, Bundle, had considerable private means, but some
obscure need of his nature drove him to discipline himself
by working eight hours a day for three pounds a week.
The three pounds was nothing to him, but the eight hours
a day meant everything. He was a conscientious worker,
but I think I have already indicated that his intelligence
was not robust. He had no delusion; he merely possessed
a misdirected sense of duty.</p>

<p>One day he left us, and a few months later I met him
in Market Street. He looked prosperous, smart and
intensely happy.</p>

<p>“Are you busy?” he asked. “No? Well, come with
me.”</p>

<p>He slipped his arm in mine, led me into Mosley Street,
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and stopped in front of the large, dismal office of the Calico
Printers’ Association.</p>

<p>“That,” said he, “is mine. Now, come into Albert
Square.”</p>

<p>When we had arrived there he pointed to the Town Hall.</p>

<p>“That also is mine. The Lord Mayor gave it to me
with a golden key. Here is the golden key.”</p>

<p>Producing an ordinary latchkey from his pocket, he
carefully held it in the palm of his hand for my inspection.</p>

<p>“It is,” he announced, “studded with diamonds. But
you can’t see the diamonds. Crafty Lord Mayor! You
don’t catch him napping. He’s hidden them deep in the
<span class="nw">gold....”</span></p>

<p>I enjoyed this poor fellow’s company more than I did
that of a very old woman to whom I was introduced in a
pauper asylum. She was sitting on a low stool and,
pointing at her head with her skinny forefinger, “It’s
pot! It’s pot!” she said.</p>

<p>But even she provided me with more exhilaration than
do the tens (or perhaps hundreds) of thousands of real
freaks who, I imagine, inhabit every part of the globe. I
allude to the vast throng of people who arise at eight or
thereabouts, go to the City every morning, work all day
and return home at dusk; who perform this routine every
day, and every day of every year; who do it all their lives;
who do it without resentment, without anger, without even
a momentary impulse to break away from their surroundings.
Such people amaze and stagger one. To them life
is not an adventure; indeed, I don’t know what they consider
it. They marry and, in their tepid, uxorious way,
love. But love to them is not a mystery, or an adventure,
and its consummation is not a sacrament. They do not
travel; they do not want to travel. They do not even
hate anybody.</p>

<p>All these people are freaks of the wildest description;
yet they imagine themselves to be the backbone of the
<a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Empire. Perhaps they are. Perhaps every nation requires
a torpid mass of people to act as a steadying influence.</p>

<p>In the suburbs of Manchester these people abound. I
know a man still in his twenties who keeps hens for what
he calls “a hobby.” Among his hens he finds all the
excitement his soul needs. The sheds in which they live
form the boundaries of his imagination. I should esteem
this man if he kicked against his destiny; but he loved
it, until the Army conscripted him. God save the world
from those who keep hens!</p>

<p>I know a man who has been to Douglas eighteen times
in succession for his fortnight’s holiday in the summer.
Douglas is his heaven; Manchester and Douglas are his
universe. No place so beautiful as Douglas; no place so
familiar; no place so satisfying. After all, Douglas is
always Douglas. Moreover, Douglas is always miraculously
“there.” God save the world from men who go
to Douglas eighteen times!</p>

<p>I know a man who hates his wife and still lives with her.
He is respectable, soulless, saving, a punctual and regular
churchgoer, a hard bargain-driver. He walks with his
eyes on the ground. He has always lived in the same
suburb. He will always live in the same suburb. God
save the world from men who always live in the same
suburb!</p>

<p>I know a <span class="nw">man ...</span></p>

<p>But this is getting very monotonous. Besides, why
should I particularise any more freaks when all of them,
perhaps, are as familiar to you as they are to me?</p>

<p>Then there is the literary freak; not the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>, not the
man who wishes to be thought “cultured” and intellectual,
but the scholarly man who, during an industrious life, has
amassed a vast amount of literary knowledge, but whose
appreciation of literature is lukewarm and without zest.
Very, very rarely is the great writer a scholar. Dr Johnson
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was a scholar, but, divine and adorable creature though
he was, he was not a great writer. None of the great
Victorians had true scholarship, and very few even of the
Elizabethans. And to-day? Well, one may consider
Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, Bernard
Shaw, Arnold Bennett and G. K. Chesterton as great
writers; if you do not concede me all these names, you
must either deny that we have any great writers at all
(which is absurd) or produce me the names of six who are
greater than those I have named (and the latter you
cannot do). Have any of these anything approaching
scholarship?</p>

<p>And yet in our universities are scores of men who are
regarded as possessing greater literary gifts than those
who actually produce literature. These learned, owlish
creatures pose pontifically. Whenever a new book comes
out they read an old one! The present generation, they
say, is without genius. But they have always said it.
They said it when Dickens, Thackeray and Charlotte
Brontë were writing. I have no doubt they said it in
Shakespeare’s time. The present generation teems with
genius, but our “scholarly” mandarins know it not.
How barren is that knowledge which lies heavy in a man’s
mind and does not fertilise there. When one considers
the matter, how essentially dull and stupid and brainless
is the man devoid of ideas!</p>

<p>One of these bald-pated freaks is well known to me.
He moves heavily about in a quadrangle. He delivers
lectures. He has written books. He passes judgment.
He annotates. He writes an occasional review. Funny
little freak! Great little freak, who knows so much and
understands so little.... When England wakes (and I
do not believe that even yet, after nearly four years of
war, England is really awake) such men will pass through
life unregarded and neglected; they will sit at home in a
back room, and their relatives and friends will love and
<a name="png.095" id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pity them, as one loves and pities a poor fellow whose
temperament has made him a wastrel, or as one pities a
man who has to be nursed.</p>

<p><span class="smc">People of the Play</span>: <i>A handful of literary freaks</i>.</p>

<p class="extraspace"><span class="smc">Scene</span>: <i>A drawing-room in Tooting, or Acton, or Highgate,
or Ealing, or any funny old place where the middle
classes live</i>.</p>

<p class="extraspace"><span class="smc">Time</span>: 8 <span class="allsc">P.M.</span> <i>on (generally) Thursday</i>.</p>

<p class="extraspace">Mrs <span class="smc">Arnold</span>. Now that Miss Vera Potting, M.A., has
finished reading her most interesting paper on Mr John Masefield, the subject is open for discussion.
Perhaps you, Mr Mather-Johnstone, will give us a
few thoughts—yes, a few thoughts. (<i>She smiles
wanly and gazes round the room.</i>) A <em>most</em> interesting
paper <em>I</em> call it.</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smc">Mather-Johnstone</span>, M.A. Miss Potting’s most
interesting paper is—well, most interesting. I must
confess I have read nothing of—er—Mr Masefield’s.
I prefer the older poets—Cowper, Bowles’ Sonnets,
and the beautifully named Felicia Hemans.
Fe-lic-i-a! To what sweet thoughts does not that
name give rise! But it has been a revelation to me
to learn that a popular poet (and Miss Potting has
assured us that Mr Masefield <em>is</em> popular) should so
freely indulge in language that, to say the least, is
violent, and I am glad to say that such language is
not to be found in the improving stanzas of Eliza
Cook.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smc">S. Wanley</span>. I have read some verses of Mr Masefield’s
in a very—well—advanced paper called, if my
memory does not deceive me, <cite>The English Review</cite>.
I did not like those verses. I did not approve of
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them. They were bathed in an atmosphere of discontent—modern
discontent. Now, what have
people to be discontented about? Nothing; nothing
at all, if they live rightly. (<i>He stops, having nothing
further to say. For the same reason, he proceeds.</i>)
Nevertheless, I thank Miss Potting, M.A., very much
for her most interesting paper. There is one question
I should like to ask her: is this Mr Masefield read by
the right people?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smc">Vera Potting</span>, M.A. Oh no! Oh dear, no!
Most certainly not! Still, it is incontestable that he
<em>is</em> read.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smc">S. Wanley</span>. Thank you so much. I felt that he
could not be read by the right people.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smc">Graceley</span> (<i>rather nervously</i>). I feel that I can say I
know my Lord Lytton, my Edna Lyall, my Charlotte
M. Yonge and my Tennyson. I have always remained
content with them, and after what Miss Vera
Potting, M.A., has said about Mr Masefield in her
most interesting paper, I shall <em>remain</em> content with
them.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smc">S. Wanley</span>. Hear, hear. I always seem to agree
with you, Miss Graceley.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smc">Arnold</span> (<i>archly</i>). What is the saying?—great minds
always jump alike?</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smc">Mather-Johnstone</span> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>). <em>Jump?</em></p>

<p>Mr <span class="smc">Porteous</span> (<i>with most distinguished amiability</i>). I really
think that this most interesting paper that Miss Vera
Potting, M.A., has read to us should be published. It
is so—well, so improving, so elevating, <span class="nw">so——</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smc">Vera Potting</span>, M.A. (<i>who has already fruitlessly sent
the essay to every magazine in the country</i>). Oh, Mr Porteous! How can you? Really, I couldn’t think
of such a thing.</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smc">Mather-Johnstone</span>, M.A. (<i>who, being not altogether
free from jealousy, thinks this is really going a bit too
<a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>far</i>). But perhaps we do not all quite approve of
women writers—I mean ladies who write for the
wide, rough public.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smc">Arnold</span>. True! True!... But then, what about
Felicia Hemans?</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smc">Mather-Johnstone</span>, M.A. Mrs Hemans was Mrs Hemans. Miss Vera Potting, M.A., is, and I hope
will always remain, Miss Vera Potting, M.A.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smc">Porteous</span>. Oh, don’t say that! What I mean <span class="nw">is——</span></p>

secretly and as though she were on some nefarious
errand</i>, Mrs <span class="smc">Arnold</span> <i>disappears from the room. She

of coffee and sandwiches. The dreadful Mr Masefield

<p>You think the above sketch is exaggerated? Ah! well,
perhaps you have never lived in Highgate, or in the
suburbs of Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield or Leeds.
I could set down some appalling conversations that I have
heard in suburban “literary” circles. There is a place
called Eccles, where, one <span class="nw">evening——</span></p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>In London Bohemia there are many freakish people,
but, for the most part, they are altogether charming and
refreshing. Quite a number of them have what I am
told is, in the Police Courts, termed “no visible means of
subsistence,” but they appear to “carry on” with imperturbable
good humour and borrow money cheerfully and
as frequently as their circle of acquaintances (which is
usually very large) will permit.</p>

<p>Frequenters of the Café Royal in pre-war days will
recognise the following <span class="nw">types:—</span></p>

<p>Picture to yourself a Polish Jew, young, yellow-skinned,
black-haired; he has luminous eyes, sensuous lips and
damp hands, and he dresses well, but in an extravagant
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>style. He is a megalomaniac, and he has all the megalomaniac’s
consuming anxiety to discover precisely in what
way other people react to his personality. One night
my bitterest enemy brought him to the table at which
I was sitting, introduced us to each other, and walked
away.</p>

<p>“I am told you are a journalist,” my new acquaintance
began. “I myself write poems. I have a theory about
poetry, and my theory is this: All poetry should be
subjective.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Never mind why. I am telling you about my theory.
All poetry should be subjective; as a matter of fact, all
the best poetry is. To myself I am the most interesting
phenomenon in the world. To yourself, you are. Is it
not so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you have guessed right first time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have in this dispatch case eight hundred and
seventy-three poems about myself, telling the world
almost all there is to know about the most interesting
phenomenon it contains.”</p>

<p>He took from his case a great pile of MS. and turned the
leaves over in his hands.</p>

<p>“Here,” said he, “is a blank-verse poem entitled <cite>How
I felt at <span class="rom">8.45 <span class="allsc">A.M.</span></span> on June <span class="rom">8, 1909,</span> having partaken of
Breakfast</cite>. Would you like to read it?”</p>

<p>I assured him I should, though I fully expected it
would contain unmistakable signs of mental disturbance.
But it did not. It was quite respectably written verse,
much better than at least half of Wordsworth’s; it was
logical, it had ideas, it showed some introspective power,
and it revealed a mind above the ordinary.</p>

<p>I told him all this.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think I’m a genius? Some people
do.”</p>

<p>“You see, I’m not a very good judge of men—particularly
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>men of genius. You may be a genius; on the
other hand, you may not.”</p>

<p>“But what exactly do you think of me?”</p>

<p>“I have already told you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not with sufficient particularity. Now, put
away from you all feeling of nervousness and try to
imagine that I have just left you and that a friend of yours
has come in and taken my place. You are alone together.
You would, of course, immediately tell him that you had
met me. You would say: ‘He is a very strange man,
eccentric....’ and so on. You would describe my appearance,
my personality, my verses. You, being a writer,
would analyse me to shreds. Now, that is what I want
you to do now. I want you to say all the bad things with
the good. And I shall listen, greedily.”</p>

<p>“But, really!” I protested. “Really, I can’t do what
you ask.”</p>

<p>Disappointed and vexed, he sat biting his underlip.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said at length, “we’ll strike a bargain.
After you have analysed me I, in return, will analyse
you.”</p>

<p>“You have quite the most unhealthy mind with which
I have ever come in contact.”</p>

<p>“You really believe that?” he asked, delighted. “Do
go on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m sorry I began. This kind of thing is
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But I like danger—mental danger
especially.”</p>

<p>“But drink would be better for you. Even drugs.
You are asking me to help to throw you off your mental
balance.”</p>

<p>“I know.<!-- TN period invisible --> I know. But you won’t refuse?”</p>

<p>“To show you that I will I am leaving you now in this
café. I am going. Good-night.”</p>

<p>But he met me many times after that, and always
<a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pursued me with ardour. In the end he gained his desire
and, having done so, had no further use for me.</p>

<p>I call him The Man Who Collects Opinions of Himself.
He is still in London. And he is not yet insane.</p>

<p>Then there was the lady—since, alas! dead—who used
always to appear in public in a kind of purple shroud, her
face and fingers chalked. She rather stupidly called herself
Cheerio Death, and was one of the jolliest girls I have
ever met. She longed and ached for notoriety and for
new sensations: she feasted on them and they nourished
and fattened her. Only very brave or reckless men dared
be seen with her in public, for, though her behaviour was
scrupulously correct, her appearance created either veiled
ridicule or consternation wherever she went. Yet she
never lacked companions.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Gerald!” she used to say to me; “sit down
near me. You are so nice and chubby. I like to have you
near me. How am I looking?”</p>

<p>“More beautiful than ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <em>are</em> sweet. Isn’t he sweet, Frank?” she
would say to one of her companions. “Order him some
champagne. I’m thirsty.”</p>

<p>And, really, Cheerio Death was very beautiful in a
ghastly and terrible way. By degrees, all the reputable
restaurants were closed to her, and in the late autumn of
1913 she disappeared, to die of consumption in Soho.
Poor girl! Perhaps in Paris, where they love the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>
and the shocking, she would have secured the full, hectic
success that in London was denied her.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Are freaks always conscious of their freakishness? I
do not think they are. Not even the man who wilfully
cultivates his oddities until they have become swollen
excrescences hanging bulbous-like on his personality is
aware how vastly different, how unreasonably different
he is from his fellows. He is more than reconciled to
<a name="png.101" id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>himself; he loves himself; he is what other people would
be if only they could. Vanity continually lulls and soothes
and rots him. The nature that craves to be noticed will
go to almost any lengths to secure that notice.</p>

<p>It has always appeared curious to me that the ambition
to become famous should very generally be regarded as a
worthy passion in a man of genius. It is but natural that
a man of genius should desire his work to reach as many
people as possible, but whether or not he should be known
as the author of that work seems to me a matter of no
importance whatever. But to the man himself it is all-important.
He has an instinctive feeling that if, in the
public eye, he is separated from his work, savour will go
from what he has created. He and his work must be
closely identified.</p>

<p>This desire to be widely known, to be talked about
everywhere, is in the man of genius accepted as natural,
but it is this very desire that, in many cases, makes a
freak of the ordinary man. Obscurity to him is death.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter IX: Fleet Street"><a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span

 />FLEET STREET</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I don’t</span> know why, but for many years there has
been (and I am told there still is) a kind of silent conspiracy
to keep out of Fleet Street as many aspirants
to journalism as possible. They are discouraged by
extravagant stories of the fierce competition that reigns
there, by tragic yarns of men of great gifts who walk
about The Street in rags. I myself was discouraged in this
way and I found myself, on the verge of middle age, still
hesitating in Manchester. It is true, I did not enter
journalism until I was in my thirties, and I did not know
the ropes. I did not know London either. Also, I was
married and had children to educate and could not afford
to take risks and make of life the grand adventure I have,
in my heart, always known it to be.</p>

<p>So I hung on in Manchester, writing musical criticism
for <cite>The Manchester Courier</cite> and contributing occasional
articles and verses to <cite>The Academy</cite>, <cite>The Contemporary
Review</cite>, <cite>The Cornhill</cite>, <cite>The English Review</cite>, <cite>The Musical
Times</cite>, and many other magazines, and there is scarcely a
London daily of repute for which at one time or another I
did not write. But still I could find no opening in Fleet
Street. The truth is, there is no regular means of finding
openings in Fleet Street<!-- TN: original reads "Strreet" -->. If an editor is in want of a
dramatic critic, a musical critic, a leader writer, or a descriptive
reporter, he never advertises for one. He always
knows someone who knows somebody else who is just the
man for the job.</p>

<p>So one day I said to myself: “I will go to London at all
<a name="png.103" id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>costs. I will take a room in Bloomsbury and risk it.”
By a happy accident I received, a few days later, a note
from Rutland Boughton, the well-known composer, telling
me that he was relinquishing his post as musical critic of
<cite>The Daily Citizen</cite>, that ill-fated paper so courageously
edited by Frank Dilnot. Boughton suggested I should
apply for the vacancy. I did apply. I wrote to Dilnot
and received no answer. I chafed a fortnight and then
telegraphed, prepaying a reply. “No vacancy at
present” was the message I received. So I took the next
train to London and bearded Dilnot in his den. “Yes,
I’ll take you,” he said, “if you’ll come for two pounds a
week. But, if you’re the real stuff, you’ll receive much
more.” As I knew that I was, indeed, the real stuff, “I’ll
come,” said I. “When can I start?”</p>

<p>I went back to Manchester and saw W. A. Ackland, the
managing editor of <cite>The Manchester Courier</cite> and the kindest
of men, expecting to receive from him a cold douche. But
no! To my amazement, he encouraged me most heartily,
and kept me on his staff, bidding me write a weekly article
for him from London. This I did till the outbreak of the
war, writing a lot of material also for his London letter.</p>

<p>During my first year in London I made six hundred
and forty pounds. And I spent it. I spent it in eager
examination of, and participation in, the many activities
that the life of a great metropolis affords. Very soon—within
six months—I found myself in the happy position
of being able to refuse work that was offered me, for I did
not wish to work all my waking hours. I wanted to play.
I did play. I made many friendships. I talked a great
deal, played the piano two or three hours a day, caroused,
ragged in Chelsea, and lived every hour of my life.</p>

<p>It may be thought that six hundred and forty pounds
per annum is no great sum. Nor is it. But does a doctor,
a barrister, a solicitor, or any other professional man earn
so much, without capital or influence, during his first year
<a name="png.104" id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in London? Or in his second? Or third? Money-making
in Fleet Street up to about seven hundred and
fifty pounds a year is the easiest thing in the world for a
man who has any talent at all for writing, especially if that
talent be combined with versatility. The journalist is
rarely intellectual; as a rule, he is merely ready and glib.
I am ready and glib myself.</p>

<p>So I am not among those who feel inclined to discourage
him who hankers after Fleet Street. No matter if you
live in the waste regions of Sutherland, if you have proved
yourself by inducing a number of editors of repute to take
your stuff, go in and win! Really, it is very easy.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>The men of Fleet Street are the best fellows in the world.
Roughly, they may be divided into two classes: those
who “go steady,” with their eye always on the main
chance, with every faculty strained to enable them to
“get on” in the world; and those happy-go-lucky people
who make money easily and spend it recklessly, so excited
by life that they cannot pause to contemplate life, so
happy in their labour and in their play that they cannot
conceive a day may come when work will be irksome and
playing a half-forgotten dream. There are, of course,
other divisions into which journalists may be separated.
There is, for example, the devoted band of brilliant young
men who work for Orage in <cite>The New Age</cite>—a paper that
cannot, I am sure, pay high rates. (What those rates are
I do not know, for I could never induce Orage to print a
single thing I wrote for him.) Then there are the hangers-on
of journalism: people who review books in the time
spared from their labours as university professors,
struggling barristers, parish priests and so on. Many of
these people, led by vanity or some other concealed
motive, offer to work without payment.</p>

<p>The men who “go steady” are the editors, the leader-writers,
the news editors, the literary editors, etc. For
<a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the most part they are men who have to keep late hours
and clear heads, for important news may reach the office
at midnight and instant decisions regarding the policy
that the paper has to assume in regard to that news have
to be made. A great political speech may be made in
Edinburgh; a startling murder trial may close in Liverpool;
a famous man may die in Paris; a strike may
break out in the Potteries: in short, anything may
happen. What attitude is the paper going to take up?
What precise shade of opinion is going to be expressed
about that political speech? What is to be said about
the degree of justice that the workers in the Potteries can
claim for their action? These matters have to be decided
instantly, for they have to be written about instantly, and
perhaps you who read the leading article next morning
rarely stop to consider the conditions—the incredibly
difficult conditions—under which it has been written.
For this kind of work real, genuine ability is required: a
very wide and accurate knowledge of affairs, rapidity of
thought, a fluent and eloquent pen and a mind so sensitive
that it can, without effort, reflect to a nicety the precise
policy of the paper upon whose work it is engaged.</p>

<p>There is a story, and I think the story is true, of a new
and inexperienced reporter who was given a trial on the
staff of a very famous “halfpenny” paper. He was not
a success, for he bungled everything that was given him
to do, and he had not an idea in his head concerning the
invention and manufacture of stunts. So he was tried as
a book-reviewer, and again failed miserably. They made
a sub-editor of him, and once more he was slow and inaccurate.
Said the news editor to the editor-in-chief: “I’m
afraid I shall have to get rid of Jones; he’s tried almost
everything and failed.” “Oh! has he?” returned the
editor-in-chief. “Well, put him on to writing leaders.”</p>

<p>But even the halfpenny Press has, in recent years, come
to regard its leader columns as one of the most important
<a name="png.106" id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>parts of its papers. Of this kind of work I have had little
experience. A position as writer of “leaderettes” was
offered me on <cite>The Globe</cite>, but I was not a success, for I was
at the same time writing a great deal of stuff for <cite>The
Daily Citizen</cite>, and, as both papers were equally violent
in antagonistic political and social fields, I soon found
myself writing solidly and regularly against my own convictions.
It is true that a journalist, like a barrister, is
generally but a hireling paid to express certain views,
but there are few men so intellectually backboneless and
ethically flabby that they can, day after day, say both
yes and no to the various problems that face them.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>I suppose there are few professions in which one learns
more about the seamy side of human nature than one does
in journalism. The one appalling vice of eminent men
is vanity. Musicians, actors, authors, politicians—even
judges and preachers—appear to be so constituted that
they cannot live and be happy without publicity. From
what source, do you think, originate those chatty little
paragraphs concerning famous men and women that you
find in every evening newspaper and in many weeklies?
They originate from the fountain-head. If the novelist
does not himself send the paragraph to the paper, his
publisher does; if the actor has not written that “snappy”
par., he has given his manager the material for it. At
one time I wrote a weekly column of theatrical gossip
for a well-known daily, and I can, without exaggeration,
say that most of our famous actors and actresses did my
work for me. I used scissors and paste, corrected their
grammatical errors (and mistakes in spelling!), coloured
the whole with my personality—and there the column was
ready for the printer! Sometimes I would receive letters
from notorious mimes expostulating with me because I
had not mentioned their names for a month or two.
Others wrote and thanked me for praising them. One
<a name="png.107" id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lady whom I have never seen, either on the stage or off,
sent me a silver pencil-case, with a letter containing the
material for a very personal sketch. I put the pencil
in my pocket and the sketch in the newspaper. Quite
recently I was shown an article signed by a famous lady,
containing a bogus account of how she had received a
strange proposal of marriage. The article had been invented
and written by an acquaintance of mine, but the
signature was the lady’s.</p>

<p>But more egregious than the vanity of actors is the
vanity of fashionable preachers. To them notoriety is
the very breath of their nostrils. They have no “agents,”
so they are compelled to advertise themselves without
camouflage. And they do it shamelessly. I will not
mention names, but at least half the fashionable preachers
in London, no matter what their denomination, are guilty
of constant and most resourceful self-advertisement. A
little, a very little, jesuitical reasoning is sufficient to satisfy
their consciences that this is done, not out of vanity, but
from a desire to bring a still larger congregation to
the fount of wisdom itself.... They are the fount of
wisdom.</p>

<p>On only two occasions have I approached an author
with a request for an interview and been refused. But I
have taken care never to approach such men as Thomas
Hardy, John Galsworthy and a few others who regard
their profession with too much respect to lend themselves
to a practice which, at its best, is undignified, and which,
at its worst, is a method of mean self-glorification.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Of “ghosting” I have done a little and seen much.
I know well a very prosperous musical composer of talent
who has paid me to write many articles that he has signed
with his own name. You call me an accomplice? But
then it was nothing to me what he did with my articles
when I had written them. Believe me, the practice is
<a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very common. The man who signs the articles furnishes
the ideas: the ghost merely expresses them.</p>

<p>The same musical composer was commissioned a few
years ago to write an orchestral work for an important
musical festival. We will call him Birket. Either Birket
was too busy to write the work or he felt he had not the
ability to do it; whatever the reason, he went to a friend
of mine—a man of far superior gifts to his more famous
colleague—and offered him a certain sum to do the work
for him. My friend—Foster will do for his name—consented,
and the work was duly performed at the festival,
conducted by Birket, and I attended in my capacity as
musical critic.</p>

<p>How eminent men who are not writers do itch to see
themselves in print! It is not enough that their speeches
are reported, their paintings and musical compositions
criticised, their sentences recorded by every daily newspaper,
their acting, singing and what not lauded to the
skies: they must themselves write: or, if they cannot
write, it must appear to the public that they have written.
Why? Just vanity. That word “vanity” will explain
nine-tenths of the seemingly inexplicable things in the
conduct of most of our public men. A man accepts a
knighthood because, as a rule, he is vain; he refuses it
for the same reason; he advertises that he has refused
it because he is vain; and, because he is vain, he refuses
to advertise that he has refused it.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>A great deal has been written about the romance of
Fleet Street. But romance is in a man’s mind and heart,
and it is true that many romantically minded men go to
Fleet Street. Fleet Street gives us a sense of importance,
a sense of too much importance. We like to feel that we
are powerful, but only a mere handful of men in The Street
have power that is worth while. What we of the rank and
file write is soon forgotten, for newspaper readers are, for
<a name="png.109" id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the most part, people who devour print greedily, neither
masticating nor assimilating the things they devour.
Newspapers confuse the mind and bring it to a state of
drugged apathy. Did you ever meet a really voracious
reader of newspapers who possessed the gift of sifting and
weighing evidence, or one who had an accurate memory,
or one who could think clearly and logically, or one who
was not bewildered and befogged by mere words?</p>

<p>But even if we men in Fleet Street have no real power,
we have what is much the same thing: we have the
illusion of power. We come into close contact with people
much more important than ourselves, and some of these
people fawn on us, for we are the necessary intermediaries
between themselves and the public.</p>

<p>But romance? Why is Fleet Street romantic? Well,
as I have already said, it is because so many journalists
themselves are romantic.... But I wonder if that really
<em>is</em> the reason, and as I wonder I begin to think that though
it is true one meets adventurous, talented and original
people by the score in newspaper offices, yet, after all,
it is not they who make journalism seem full of savour,
of rich delight, of unexpectedness and excitement, of high
romance. No; it is writing itself that is romantic: mere
words and the colour and music of words; the smell of
printers’ ink; the wet feel of a paper fresh from the press;
the sounds of telephone bells and of machinery; the joy
of expressing oneself; the lovely, great joy of signing one’s
name to an article and knowing that in twenty-four hours
it will have been read or glanced at by perhaps half-a-million
people.... But it seems to me as I write that I
am utterly failing to communicate to you who read the
romantic nature of journalism. To you it is, perhaps,
merely a slipshod profession, a profession in which there
is something sordid and vulgar and as unromantic as
Monday morning. To me a man who writes with distinction
is the most interesting creature in the world: I
<a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cannot know too much about him; I can never tire
of his talk. Actors bore me. So do politicians, lawyers,
men of science, those who are professionally religious,
doctors, musicians. But writers and financiers—especially
Jewish financiers—are to me full of subtlety; their
souls are elusive, and their minds are cunning past all
reckoning. It is frequently said that the art of writing
is possessed by most people. The art of writing correctly
may be, but the “correct” writer is frequently not a
writer at all, for he cannot compel people to read him. A
writer without readers is not a writer; he is simply a man
who murmurs to himself very laboriously. But the writer
who can claim thousands of readers—I mean even such
writers as Mr Charles Garvice and the lady who invented
<cite>The Rosary</cite>—are in essentials more highly endowed with
the true writer’s gifts than many mandarins who live
cloistered in Oxford and Cambridge. And I say this in
spite of the fact that I have never been able to read more
than ten consecutive pages of any book of Mr Garvice’s
that I have picked up, and that <cite>The Rosary</cite> seems to me
a story of such amazing flapdoodleism <span class="nw">that——</span></p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Arnold Bennett says somewhere that living in the
theatrical world is like living a story out of <cite>The Arabian
Nights</cite>. To me Fleet Street is more amazing than the
bazaars of Cairo, more mysterious than the hermaphroditic
Sphinx. And perhaps one of the most amazing
things about Fleet Street is the easy way in which many
men earn money.</p>

<p>Some years ago I was on the staff of a paper where I
had for a colleague a dark blue-eyed young man who
was our crime specialist. He had just come from the
provinces, and had not even a rudimentary notion of how
to write. He knew he couldn’t write; he boasted of it.
And he cared nothing for newspapers or books or anything
even remotely connected with literature. But he had an
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>amazing talent for sniffing out crime. I remember a
great jewel robbery which he got wind of half-a-day before
anyone else, and, in a way known only to himself, he
obtained full particulars of the affair, writing a half-column
“story” before any other paper in the kingdom
even knew there was a story to write. He entertained me
vastly, and I used to go with him sometimes at night
when he called at Scotland Yard for news. Scotland Yard
never gives away news unless it is in its own interest to do
so. But I am very much inclined to believe that it was
somewhere in Scotland Yard that he obtained his most
valuable information. We would walk down wide
corridors there together, sit ten minutes in a waiting-room,
interview an official who invariably said: “Nothing
doing to-night,” and come away. But that was quite
enough for my friend. “I must go to Poplar straight
away,” he would say, as we came away; or perhaps: “I
can just catch the last train to Guildford”; or “There is
nothing at all in the rumour of that murder in Battersea.”
I used to look at him in amazement and exclaim: “But
how do you <em>know</em>?” “Ah!” he would reply; “they
say that walls have ears. But much more frequently
they have tongues.”</p>

<p>This man was paid three pounds a week by our editor.
Three times out of four he was ahead of every other paper
in his news, and I was not in the least surprised when one
day, after he had been in London only two months, he
came to me and said: “Next week I am leaving you. I
am going to <cite>The Morning Trumpet</cite>; they’re giving me
five hundred pounds a year.” Five months later he was
getting a thousand pounds a year from a paper that never
hesitates to pay handsomely for “stunts.”</p>

<p>I caught fire from my friend’s enthusiasm, and late one
night, just when I had finished a long notice of a new play,
I overheard the night editor regretting to one of the sub-editors
that news of a particularly horrible murder in
<a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Stepney had just reached the office when all the reporters
were out on duty. “Let me go!” I urged. “But you
are in evening dress,” he objected. “Never mind; send
me off.” And ten minutes later I was being rushed in a
taxi-cab at full speed to Stepney. I found the scene of
the murder—a mean little house in a mean little street.
Outside the house was a crowd of eager loafers, a score
of reporters, and as many policemen, who, refusing to be
bribed, kept us all in the street without news. However,
such was my enthusiasm that I alone of all the reporters
got into the house and into the cellar where the wretched
woman had been butchered to death three hours earlier.
I drew a hasty plan of the underground floor, interviewed
a sister of the murdered woman, obtained full particulars,
and then jumped into the taxi-cab to return to the office.
Within an hour of leaving my desk I was back again, and
in another twenty minutes I had ready as vivid and
thrilling a “story” as ever I hope to write. Knowing that
the paper was on the point of going to press, I did not, as
I ought to have done, hand my copy to one of the sub-editors,
but took it straight to the machines. Whilst
I was waiting for a proof, I was summoned to my editor’s
room. He was frowning, and he looked very much
perturbed.</p>

<p>“By the merest chance, Cumberland,” he said, sternly,
“I have been the means of saving the paper from heavy
penalties for contempt of court.” He paused and bit his
lip. “I suppose you think your murder story a most
brilliant piece of work.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly was under that impression, sir,” I
began, “but it would <span class="nw">seem——”</span></p>

<p>“<em>Seem!</em>” he thundered. “You’ve got the facts, it’s
true, but then all my reporters have to get the facts. The
gross blunder you’ve made is, first of all, in saying that the
suspected man has spent practically all his life in prison—contempt
of court of the vilest description. Secondly,
<a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you’ve said——” He enumerated no fewer than five
blunders I had made. “But, worst of all,” he concluded,
“you took it upon yourself to give your copy direct to the
printers after midnight, thus breaking the strictest rule
of this office.”</p>

<p>It was true. In my exciting enthusiasm I had forgotten
this Persian rule.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, I came in just in time to stop your stuff.
You’d better, I think, confine yourself exclusively to
your dramatic criticism.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he offered me, two days later, ten pounds
a week to give up my dramatic criticism and general
articles (for which I was at that time getting only five
pounds) and devote myself to reporting—an offer which
I refused, as the work would have exhausted all my
time.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It was at about this time that the idea occurred to me
that a certain monthly magazine for which I had been
writing regularly might, if asked, pay me at a higher rate
than that which, till then, they had been giving me. So I
dressed myself very carefully (clothes <em>do</em> help, don’t they?)
and drove up to the office in a smart hansom.</p>

<p>“I have called about my articles,” I began, rather
brusquely, to the editor, a scholarly man who knew far
more about Elizabethan literature than he did about
human nature. “I have found just lately that I am so
busy that I have resolved to give up some of my work.
Your magazine is one of those with which I am anxious
to retain my connection, partly because my relationship
with you has always been so pleasant.”</p>

<p>And I stopped. It is not everyone who knows the
right place at which to stop in conversations of this kind.
“My relationship with you has always been so pleasant”
was, most indubitably, the right place.</p>

<p>He tried to force me into further talk by remaining
<a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>silent himself. A clock ticked: a clock always does
tick on these occasions. He coughed. I looked steadily
towards the window. For a full minute there must have
been silence: to me it seemed an hour; to him I have
no doubt it seemed eternity.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr Cumberland, we shall be able to come
to a satisfactory arrangement,” he said, when eternity
had passed. “What do you say to such-and-such an
amount?”</p>

<p>And he staggered me by mentioning a sum exactly
treble the amount I had been receiving for the last two
years.</p>

<p>As I walked into the Strand, I felt a mean and disagreeable
bargain-driver, but after I had lunched at
Simpson’s, I said to myself: “What a fool you were not
to go to see him twelve months ago!”</p>

<p>But though many people equally as obscure as myself
earn a thousand pounds a year by their pens, you must
not imagine that all the men who are famous writers do
likewise. By no means always does it happen that a man
combines literary genius and the power of earning money,
and there are many men rightly honoured in our own day
whose earnings do not involve them in the payment of
income tax. The faculty of making money, no matter
whether it is made out of the sale of pills or poems, tripe
or tragedies, is innate. No man by taking thought can
add a thousand pounds a year to his income, for money
is not made by thought but by intuition.</p>

<p>I know a man in Chelsea who earns fifteen hundred
pounds a year by writing what, in my schoolboy days,
we called (and perhaps they are still called) “bloods.”
He knocks off a cool five thousand words a day every day
for three weeks, and then takes a week’s holiday—boys’
“bloods,” servant-girls’ novelettes, children’s fairy tales
and newspaper serials. He is a cheerful, energetic man,
whose hobbies are bull-dogs and Shakespeare, and he has
<a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>five different pen-names. For the matter of that, I use
three different pseudonyms, my reason for doing this being
that the editor of <cite>The Spectator</cite>, say, might not accept my
work if he knew I was writing at the same time for <cite>The
English Review</cite> (I have written for both publications),
and I am doubtful if <cite>The Morning Post</cite> would have printed
a single word of mine if the editor had been aware that I
was having a thousand words a day printed in <cite>The Daily
Citizen</cite>. Some editors like what they call “versatility
of thought,” others (I think rightly) distrust it.</p>

<p>But I can very well believe that this gossip about money
appears to you very sordid. Well, so it is. My final
paragraph shall not be permitted to mention, or even hint
at, hard cash.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Once again I return to my statement that Fleet Street
is romantic because many of the people in it are romantic.
But what is a romantic person? Alas! I cannot define
one. Perhaps a romantic person is he whose soul is
mysterious and elusive and whose mind is perturbed and
exalted by a poetic vision of life. He must care little for
the things that Mr Samuel Smiles and the “get on or
get out” school value so much.... No. That will not
do at all, for a great many men and women who have
cared a great deal for money and worldly power were
romantic. Nero, for example, and Cleopatra, and Shakespeare,
and Queen Elizabeth, and Lord <span class="nw">Verulam——</span></p>

<p>But though a romantic man may be difficult to define,
he is very easy to recognise. Ivan Heald was incorrigibly
romantic. But perhaps the most romantically minded
man I met in Fleet Street was the journalist who went with
me to Athens in the very early spring of 1914. He had
no right in Fleet Street, for he was essentially a man who
preferred to do things rather than write about them. But
half the men in London journalism have drifted there
not so much because they have a natural aptitude for the
<a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>work but because they are born adventurers, and the
great adventure of Fleet Street is bound to cross the path
of most roving men one day or another.</p>

<p>Years ago there lived in London a man who wrote books
and magazine stories under the name of Julian Croskey.
He had been in the Civil Service in Shanghai, had helped
to finance and organise a rebellion, and had been turned
out of China, whence he came to England to write. In
1901 I began a correspondence with Croskey, who, in the
meantime, had gone to Canada and was living alone on a
river island. Though we corresponded for years, we never
met, and after a time his letters began to show signs of
megalomania. But there was such genius in his letters,
such brooding energy, such hate of life, and, at times, such
an uncanny suggestion of terrific power, that I treasured
every word he wrote to me, and, when his letters ceased,
something vital and something almost necessary to me
passed out of my life. I do not like to believe that he
ceased writing to me because I no longer interested him.
I hope he still lives. I hope he will read this book. Some
day his letters must be published, for they constitute a
problem in psychology at once fascinating, mysterious and
demonic. And this man whom I never met remains to
me the most romantic of all men I have met in the spirit.</p>

 />HALL CAINE</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">My</span> acquaintance with Hall Caine began in a semi-professional
way. Whilst still a schoolboy, I
was commissioned by <cite>Tit-Bits</cite> to write a three-column
interview with him. I wrote to the novelist for
an interview. Perhaps the rawness of my letter aroused
the suspicion that I was too young to write adequately
about him even in a paper of the standing of <cite>Tit-Bits</cite>;
at all events he refused the interview, but very kindly said
that, if I was contemplating a visit to the Isle of Man, he
would be pleased if I would call on and lunch with him as
an unprofessional visitor. At that time, being young and
ardent, I was a young and ardent admirer of his, and I
believe I told him so in my letter that requested the
interview.</p>

<p>If I went to him as an admirer I came away from that
first visit to Greeba Castle a worshipper. In those days
he was (but he still is!) an astounding personality. He
came into the room quietly and, having shaken hands and
sat down by my side, said: “An exquisite day for your
walk from St John’s.” So impressively was this spoken,
and there was such a fire in his eyes as he said it, such a
weight of meaning in his manner, that I felt as though
something secret and wonderful had been revealed to me.
I wanted to say: “How true!” What I did say was:
“Yes; isn’t it?” He asked me a few questions about
myself and then spoke about general matters. He probably
said quite trivial, kindly things, but at the time they
<a name="png.118" id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were uttered, and for a little while afterwards, they
seemed rich and full of wisdom.</p>

<p>After lunch he showed me the MSS. of some of his books.
I remember the MS. of <cite>The Bondman</cite>. It was written in
a small, curiously artistic handwriting on half sheets of
notepaper, which had been pasted on to much larger
sheets handsomely bound. I handled the book as reverently
as the young ladies of early days caressed the pages
of the great Martin Tupper. There were many “blots”
in the MS.—many alterations, excisions and additions,
and it was clear, even from a cursory examination, that
Mr Hall Caine was a hard and conscientious worker.
Upon this and other books he left me to browse for an
hour whilst he went to receive other callers—all of them
strangers to him—who were just arriving.</p>

<p>Some of those visitors, as I discovered later, were a
rather extraordinary crew: men and women from Lancashire
and Yorkshire: I mean <em>absolutely</em> from Lancashire
and Yorkshire: men and women who had made a little
money and who had unbounded respect for people who
had made a little more: men and women who were sound
and good, but not quite educated and who were either like
fish out of water, gasping and floundering spasmodically,
or positively frightfully at their ease. I recollect a tall
and handsome lady who prodded everything with a green
parasol, and two men who, not too furtively, made
elaborate efforts to estimate the amount of the author’s
income.</p>

<p>We had tea on a terrace in the grounds and in the
evening I was driven back to St John’s, all the other callers
returning to Douglas.</p>

<p>The impression left by Mr Hall Caine’s personality on
my mind by that and many subsequent visits was overwhelming.
He was vivid, alive, and full of smouldering
fires; short and vehement; his eyes were large and
bright; his voice beautiful and capable of a thousand
<a name="png.119" id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>inflections—an actor’s voice; his temperament also an
actor’s; his point of view an actor’s. But he never did
act; invariably he was tragically (and, I must add, sometimes
pathetically) sincere. He had humour, but he
could not laugh at himself. His dress was eccentric; he
wore a flapping hat, breeches and a jacket made of thick,
everlasting, hand-made cloth. A big tie bulged and
billowed somewhere about his neck. He told me on one
occasion that chars-à-bancs full of trippers from Douglas
continually passed along the Douglas-Peel road and that
when the trippers caught a sight of him they would sometimes
hail him with cries of derision and shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>“At those moments,” he said, “I am always most
dignified. I raise my hat to them and bow and their
laughter immediately ceases.”</p>

<p>That I could well believe, for there is something commanding
in his personality, something well calculated to
quell insolence.</p>

<p>A desultory correspondence and a few casual visits
followed during the next three or four years, and when I
was in my very early twenties I persuaded Messrs Greening
&amp; Company to invite me to write a book on Hall Caine for
a popular series (<cite>English Writers of To-day</cite>, it was called)
they were at that time issuing. Mr Caine, upon being
approached by me, put no hindrance in my way, but, on
the contrary, consented to give me some assistance in the
way of providing me with information and a few letters
received by him from eminent men. I spent several
week-ends at Greeba Castle and found in Mrs Caine,
always charming and ideally gifted with tact, a delightful
hostess. My book was quickly written. It was a feeble,
bombastic and ridiculous performance. A friend of mine
(I thought he was an enemy) called it “a prolonged
diarrhœa of the emotions.” In this book Hall Caine took
a very kindly interest, and he provided me with autograph
letters written by Ruskin, Blackmore, T. E. Brown and
<a name="png.120" id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Gladstone to insert in my book. But I was, of course,
the sole author of the work, and Mr Caine had nothing to
do with it save to put me right on matters of fact and to
tone down some of my exuberant and sentimental praise.
The silly volume, because of its subject, attracted a good
deal of attention, both in this country and in America,
though it was not published in the States. <cite>The Philadelphia
Daily Eagle</cite>, for example, on the day the book was
published, printed a eulogistic cablegram review of it
from London. But, for the most part, my monograph
was mercilessly slated. Hall Caine, in addition, was
abused for consenting to be the subject of it, and I was
abused for having chosen him for my subject. One paper
headed its review “Raising Caine.”</p>

<p>The truth is, at this time (1901) Mr Hall Caine, though
extraordinarily popular with the public, was not much
liked by a certain section of the Press. His success was
envied by some, perhaps; his recognition of his own worth
was fiercely and almost universally resented; and his
almost unconscious habit of advertising himself—though
he did not indulge this habit more than most popular
novelists—could not be tolerated. Mr Caine used frequently
to deplore his only too palpable unpopularity
with the Press, and once or twice he asked me to explain
it. His own theory was that he had a few powerful
enemies who took advantage of every occasion to disseminate
lies about him, but who these enemies were he
never stated. As a matter of fact, he occasionally said
injudicious things to reporters which, in cold print,
appeared not only self-satisfied but vainglorious. A
long and very well written article by Mr Robert H. Sherard, in (I believe) <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> caused him a
good deal of anxiety.</p>

<p>Not often does one find a man of Hall Caine’s very
special gifts endowed with the abilities of a financier. He
is as quick and as clever at driving a bargain as a
<a name="png.121" id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lancashire or Yorkshire mill-owner. There have always been
and, I suppose, always will be a large percentage of writers
who are constitutionally incapable of looking after their
own affairs; they can produce, but they cannot sell.
Mr Hall Caine does not belong to these. He, more than
any man, contributed to the breakdown of the three-volume
novel system. It was he who helped to formulate
the Canadian Copyright Laws. With the assistance of
Major Pond (who in these days remembers the great Major
Pond?) he made tens of thousands of dollars by lecturing
to the Americans. He had the acumen and the courage to
issue one of his longest novels in two volumes at two
shillings net each. He was the first eminent novelist to
make a practice of publishing his works in the middle
of the August holidays—the supposed “dead” season in
the publishing world. He has bought farms in the Isle
of Man and made them pay. He has had commercial
interests in seaside boarding-houses and has shown a bold
but wise enterprise in many of his investments. In other
words he has, to his honour, continually exhibited abilities
that not one artist in a hundred possesses.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen Hall Caine in a light-hearted mood,
but I have been with him in more than one hour of black
depression.</p>

<p>Vividly do I remember spending a few days at Greeba
Castle shortly after the time when the publication of a
story of his, that was running serially in a ladies’ paper,
was suddenly and dramatically stopped by the editor of
that paper on the score of its alleged immorality. The
story was about to be produced in book form and, of
course, the editor’s action had provided a fine advertisement;
this fact, however, did not appear to console the
novelist in the least. The most sensitive of men, he was
crushed by this very public charge of writing immoral
literature.</p>

<p><a name="png.122" id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>For myself, when he told me all the circumstances, I
merely laughed. He glanced at me sideways.</p>

<p>“You are amused?” he asked. “I wonder why.”</p>

<p>“Because you are allowing yourself to be made miserable
by a most trivial event.”</p>

<p>“You call it trivial that the whole world should think
me a man of immoral mind?”</p>

<p>“The whole world? Why, the world doesn’t trouble
itself about the matter in the least. Only one man accuses
you of immoral writings; that man is the editor of the
paper. What on earth does his opinion matter to
you?”</p>

<p>“But his opinion will be widely read and will be widely
believed.”</p>

<p>“Will be believed, you should have added, by people
who allow another man to form their opinions for them.
What do <em>they</em> matter?”</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>“But they <em>do</em> matter,” said he, rather forlornly. “I
hate to think of people out there”—he waved a vague
arm in the direction of the kitchen garden—“thinking
evil thoughts and saying evil things of me.”</p>

<p>“‘They say. What do they say? Let them say,’”
I quoted.</p>

<p>We paced up and down the terrace, his eyes fixed on the
ground. At length:</p>

<p>“I wonder what you would think of the chapter in
question,” he said musingly. “You have read the story
as far as it has been printed. Well, I will give you the
final chapters to read.”</p>

<p>We went to his room and he handed me a few pages of
printed copy. I read them.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired he, when I had finished.</p>

<p>“It is passionate, it is sexual,” said I, “but to call it
immoral is to call black white.”</p>

<p>“You really believe that?” he asked, a little anxiously.</p>

<p><a name="png.123" id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“I do. I assure you I do.”</p>

<p>But the black cloud of self-distrust and misery
would not be dissipated, and that night, after dinner,
we sat over a slow fire, though it was early in
August, and talked long and rather sadly of Rossetti,
of T. E. Brown and of things that had been said by
Peel fishermen.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Another occasion, when I was with the novelist on a
day of some anxiety, is equally clear in my memory. I
may say at this point that Hall Caine was invariably in a
condition of some mental strain a few days before and
after the publication of one of his stories. He was a little
apprehensive of the reviewers, and he was always afraid
lest the public should not remain faithful to him. In this
connection I remember him saying to me once: “I can
imagine no fate more tragic than for a novelist at middle
age, when he believes his powers to be at their highest,
to lose his hold upon his public.”</p>

<p>He would, I think, deny that he cares what the reviewers
may say; nevertheless, my experience of him tells me
that he does care. In his early life as a novelist he was,
perhaps, overpraised; certainly he but very rarely felt
the lash of the critic’s whip. So that when the critics
began to condemn the work of the man they had once
praised, he was not disciplined to bear their condemnation
philosophically. Every taunt wounded him, every thrust
went home, every sneer was a stab.</p>

<p>But on the occasion about which I am now writing he
was not depressed so much in anticipation of what the
reviewers might say as on account of the competition of
another novel which had been issued a few days previous
to the date fixed for the publication of a new book of his
own. That novel was Lucas Malet’s <cite>The History of Sir
Richard Calmady</cite>, published, if my memory does not
betray me, by Messrs Methuen.</p>

<p><a name="png.124" id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The first question he asked me one morning before
breakfast was:</p>

<p>“Have you read <cite>Sir Richard Calmady</cite>?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well?” exclaimed he, a little impatiently, “well,
what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“An amazingly clever performance, but very horrible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” he cried eagerly. “Horrible!
Ghastly! And yet, they tell me, people are reading it.”</p>

<p>“Partly for that reason, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“But the public, the people, the great reading public—surely
they will not respond to the appeal of a book of that
nature?”</p>

<p>“The public, you must remember, has many hearts;
it may well give one to Sir Richard Calmady.”</p>

<p>“But <em>my</em> public?”</p>

<p>“Yes; even your public.”</p>

<p>He brooded a little.</p>

<p>“I am told that Lucas Malet’s publishers believe in the
book,” he said, after a longish pause, “and are prepared
to spend a small fortune in pushing it. And that, of
course, means that it will interfere with, and perhaps
seriously injure, the sales of my own story. But it seems
to me that the public—the <em>real</em> public—will never read a
novel that has for its chief attraction a man with no legs.”</p>

<p>I suggested that he should postpone the publication of
his book until the rage for <cite>Sir Richard Calmady</cite> had died
down. But no! This would not suit him. He must
catch the real holiday season at its full tide. August was
the best month in the year, and the first week the best
week in the month, and the fifth day the best day of the
week.</p>

<p>Hall Caine always shows great perspicacity in selecting
the date of publication for his books; he will never allow
it to synchronise with any other big event. Moreover, his
book must be born to an expectant world; it must be well
<a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>advertised beforehand. Unlike other writers, he does not
work hard at a book, finish it and then hand it over to a
publisher to deal with more or less as he thinks fit. In a
sense, he is his own publisher, and as a rule he interests
himself in the sale of a new work of his own, in its distribution,
its printing and binding, etc., as much as the
actual publisher himself.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It used to be a popular belief—but Arnold Bennett has
done much to kill it—that an author laughs and cries with
the creatures of his imagination, that he lives and dreams
with them, and that when his book is finished, and the time
comes for him to part from them, he does so with pain that
is little short of anguish. So far as most authors are concerned,
this is exactly opposite to the real facts. Before
an author is half-way through his novel he is heartily sick
of his characters; his beautiful heroine is an unmitigated
nuisance and his hero an incredible bore. He is only too
thankful to reach the end of the last chapter and leave his
puppets for ever.</p>

<p>But this is not so with Hall Caine. His novels, as you
know, do not err on the side of brevity, and though it is
possible you may tire of his heroine, you may be absolutely
certain that her creator never does. To this novelist the
creatures of his imagination are, in one sense, more real
than the material beings around him. He is wholly
dominated by his imagination. His brain is peopled by
creatures of his own fancy. His emotions are engaged on
behalf of people who do not exist. His consciousness is
confined to the little world he has created for himself and
he is saturated with and submerged by fancies that his
imagination has bred.</p>

<p>I shall never forget coming across him early one morning
in the little shaded footway that winds among trees in the
castle grounds to the main drive. His eyes were dim, and
he had not perfect control of his voice.</p>

<p><a name="png.126" id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“I have been finishing my book,” he said, referring to
<cite>The Eternal City</cite>, “and I wept as I wrote.”</p>

<p>I have been with him on several occasions when he has
been finishing his books, and I have always found him in
alternating moods of exhaustion and emotional excitement.
Whatever else may be charged against him, it
cannot with truth be said that he does not put his whole
soul into his work.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>As a man he is the most loyal of friends and the most
loyal of enemies. He can hate bitterly. I have heard him
eloquent in his hate. I have heard him hate W. T. Stead
and Frank Harris, and nothing could have exceeded his
bitterness. But he does not nurse his hatred, and he is a
man quick to forgive.</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without a word concerning
his generosity. By “generosity” I do not mean only
that he is free with money, but that he will give his time,
the work of his brain, his advice and even himself for any
good cause and for any man in need. To struggling
authors he is the very soul of generosity. He struggled
himself. Born on a coal barge in Runcorn, largely self-educated,
having experienced the anxiety of straitened
means and hope deferred, he has known intimately the
hardships of life, and will do all in his power to shield others
from them. On several occasions I have met people—mostly
young men—who have come to him for help and
advice in beginning a literary career. He is never
extravagant in his praise of their work, but if he finds
merit in it he is always warmly encouraging. Years
before I met him face to face, when I was a boy of fourteen,
I sent him a long poem I had written in the Spenserian stanza,
and the first letters I received from him
were careful and most helpful criticisms of this juvenile
literary effort. I had written to him as an entire stranger
and without any introduction whatever. In my youth
<a name="png.127" id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and egotism I had taken his replies as a matter of course;
it was only later that I recognised the most kindly spirit
that prompted a busy and often harassed man to give his
time and energy to a boy whose work can have had very
little to recommend it.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I wonder</span> how many readers turn nowadays to
the poetical works of Thomas Edward Brown, the
Manx poet. Not a great number, I think. Indeed,
I doubt if he ever had a large audience, though he had the
power of exciting almost unlimited enthusiasm in the
breasts of those whom he did attract. He was praised
whole-heartedly by George Eliot, George Meredith,
W. E. Henley and other famous writers, and the publication
of his Letters a year or two after his death made a
great stir.</p>

<p>In my boyhood’s days I was one of Brown’s most
devoted disciples. He had a charming trick of infusing
scholarship with the real “stuff” of humanity, that appealed
to me irresistibly, and I liked the honest sensuality
of his <cite>Roman Women</cite> and the pathos of such poems as
<cite>Aber Stations</cite> and <cite>Epistola ad Dakyns</cite>. Perhaps I could
not read his poems now, for, truth to tell, they “gush”
almost indecently. However, he remains the most
distinguished literary figure that the little Isle of Man
has produced, and two or three of his lyrics will persist
far into the future.</p>

<p>I met him at Greeba Castle, Mr Hall Caine’s Manx
residence, when I was still a schoolboy. It was just a
few months before Brown’s death, and a rather sad
incident marked his visit to Hall Caine.</p>

<p><a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>We were at lunch when he arrived: a rather solemn
lunch: a lunch at which the guests were ill assorted. A
ponderous scholar from Scotland insisted upon discussing
the authorship of Homer—a subject about which our
host evidently knew little and cared less. In the middle
of a rather painful silence, Brown was ushered into the
dining-room; he was carrying a little book of Laurence
Binyon’s that had just been published. His burly figure,
his genial face, his ready tongue soon lifted us out of the
atmosphere of black boredom that had settled upon us.
In five minutes he had disposed of the Scottish scholar,
had drunk a whisky and soda, and had combated Hall
Caine’s opinion that Binyon “had entirely missed the
point” in one of the poems he (Binyon) had written.</p>

<p>All afternoon we talked. Brown had come all the way
from Ramsey (some twenty-four miles, four of which had
to be walked) to spend a few hours with his friend, and,
as he was a man greedy of enjoyment, not a single moment
was wasted. It soon appeared that Brown was a great
admirer of Hall Caine’s—it should be mentioned that Mr Caine had not then written <cite>The Prodigal Son</cite> or <cite>The
Eternal City</cite>—and the novelist basked in the tactful praise
that was bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>As we were talking, a servant came with the news that
eleven Americans had arrived and had been shown into
the library. Hall Caine left the room to give them tea.
An hour later, he came back, exhausted but not displeased.</p>

<p>“One of the penalties of fame,” he said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“But you are not the only one who suffers from your
own fame,” observed Brown. “I am constantly besieged
by American journalists, who come to me for private
information about yourself. A very persistent lady from
New York came only the other day and wished to know
if you were educated.”</p>

<p>Hall Caine laughed.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” he asked.</p>

<p><a name="png.130" id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Well, I asked her what she meant by ‘education,’
and she replied: ‘Is he at all like Matthew Arnold?’”</p>

<p>Towards evening, Brown departed.</p>

<p>Next morning, a note arrived from him, evidently
written immediately on his return home the previous
evening. The note expressed the writer’s regret that he
had been unable to visit Greeba Castle that day; he had
fully intended coming, but had been prevented at the
last moment. This letter disturbed Hall Caine enormously.</p>

<p>“His mind is going,” he said; “I have noticed several
other signs of vanishing memory, if not of something worse,
during the last few months.”</p>

<p>There was, indeed, I have always thought, a streak of
morbid eccentricity in Brown’s intellectual make-up. A
careful reader of his letters will notice many moods of
fierce exaltation engendered by wholly inadequate and
inexplicable causes. His sudden death was perhaps a
blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>There are in London two or three men, not known
to the general public, whose influence on modern thought
is most profound and most disturbing. Of these men
A. R. Orage, the editor of <cite>The New Age</cite>, is quite the most
distinguished. What circulation his paper enjoys, I do
not know; it cannot be large; probably it is not more
than two or three thousand; perhaps it is not even so
much as that. But the men and women who read it are
men and women who count—people who welcome daring
and original thought, who hold important positions in the
civic, social, political and artistic worlds, and who eagerly
disseminate the seeds of thought they pick up from the
study of <cite>The New Age</cite>. Tens of thousands of people have
been influenced by this paper who have never even
heard its name. It does not educate the masses directly:
it reaches them through the medium of its few but
exceedingly able readers.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><cite>The New Age</cite> is professedly a Socialist organ, but the
promulgation of socialistic doctrines is only a part of
its policy and work. Its literary, artistic and musical
criticism is the sanest, the bravest and the most brilliant
that can be read in England. It reverences neither power
nor reputation; it is subtle and unsparing; and, if it is
sometimes cruel, it is cruel with a purpose. All sleek
money-makers in Art have reason to fear Orage, for his
rapier wit may at any moment glance and slide between
their ribs and release the hot air that is at once the
inspiration and the material of all their works.</p>

<p>Orage has more than a touch of genius. It was
Baudelaire (wasn’t it?) who said that genius was the
power to look upon the world with the eyes of a child.
Well, Orage has the all-seeing, non-rejecting eyes of
a child. He has also the eternal spirit of youth. One
cannot imagine him growing old. Perhaps his most
interesting characteristic is his power of attracting and
holding friends; he is the most hero-worshipped of men.
Having once given his friendship, however, he exacts
the utmost loyalty; treachery is the one sin that can
never be forgiven.</p>

<p>I knew Orage years ago, when he was still in Leeds
teaching the young idea how to shoot. He was then a
prominent member of the Theosophical Society and
lectured a good deal—and rather dangerously, I think—on
Nietzsche. His gospel, always preached with his
tongue in his cheek, that every man and woman should
do precisely what he or she desires, acted like heady wine
on the gasping and enthusiastic young ladies who used to
sit in rows worshipping him. They wanted to do all
kinds of terrible things, and as Orage, backed by “that
great German,” Nietzsche, had sanctioned their most
secret desires, they were resolved to begin at once their
career of licence. They used to “stay behind” when the
lectures were over, and question Orage with their lips and
<a name="png.132" id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>invite him with their eyes, and it used to be most amusing
and a little pathetic to listen to the gay and half-veiled
insults with which Orage at once thwarted and bewildered
his silly devotees.</p>

<p>He had in those days a wonderful gift of talking a
most divine nonsense—a spurious wisdom that ran closely
along the border-line of rank absurdity. The “cosmic
consciousness” of Walt Whitman was a great theme of
his, and Orage, in his subtle, devilishly clever way, would
lead his listeners on to the very threshold of occult
knowledge—and leave them there, wide-eyed and wonder-struck.</p>

<p>I have never known an editor more jealous of the reputation
of his paper than Orage is of <cite>The New Age</cite>. No consideration
of friendship would induce him to print a dull
article, however sound, and when one of his contributors
becomes sententious, or slack, or banal—out he goes,
neck and crop. Among the contributors to <cite>The New Age</cite>
I remember writers as different in mental calibre as John
Davidson and Edward Carpenter, Frank Harris and Cecil
Chesterton, Arnold Bennett and Janet Achurch. These
and scores of equally distinguished people have written for
Orage. Why? For money? Well, scarcely; <cite>The New
Age’s</cite> rates of pay must be very modest. For what, then?
They have written because in <cite>The New Age</cite> they can tell
the unadulterated truth and because they are proud to
see their work in that paper.</p>

<p>To many people Norman Angell is a rather sinister
figure, and the people who attack him most violently
to-day are precisely those who praised him most when he
wrote his first book. He has been overpraised and spoilt.
His intellectual attainments are not greatly above the
average, and his thinking is not always honest. In the
early days of the war it used to be amusing to see
him working among his spectacled and yellow-skinned
<a name="png.133" id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>assistants; he was small but magisterial, and he was
always tucking sheets of foolscap into long envelopes
and looking very important as he did so. I really believe
that in those days of August, 1914, he had a vague idea
that he and his helpers could stop the war at any moment
they chose. Certainly, he was very cross with the war.
Europe was behaving in her old, mad way without having
previously consulted him.</p>

<p>“But it will soon be over,” he assured me. “You
<span class="nw">see——”</span></p>

<p>He stopped and waved his hand vaguely in the direction
of a typewriter, smothered in documents.</p>

<p>“Quite,” said I uncomprehendingly. “You mean——?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s it. Exhaustion. It can’t go on for ever.
It must stop some time.”</p>

<p>A smile that came from nowhere straggled into his face.
I felt vaguely discomfited.</p>

<p>“You see, we are hard at it,” he said, and, as he
spoke, be indicated a pale, ill-shaven youth who was
wandering aimlessly about the office, his hands full of
papers.</p>

<p>A queer little chap, Angell. Very much in earnest, of
course, very sure of himself, very pushing, very “idealistic.”</p>

<p>St John Ervine is a writer who already counts for much
but who, a few years hence, will count for a good deal
more. He is by way of being a protégé of Bernard Shaw,
and earnest young Fabians have already learned to
reverence him.</p>

<p>We worked together on <cite>The Daily Citizen</cite>, he being
dramatic critic. He was not enormously popular with
the rest of the staff, for he was very “high-brow”; his
face was smooth, sleek and superior, and he had a habit of
being friendly with a man one day and scarcely recognising
him the next. My own relations with him were of the
most disagreeable. A play of his was given at the Court
<a name="png.134" id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Theatre, and I was sent to criticise it. I did criticise it:
the play was ugly, clever and sordid.</p>

<p>“But,” protested Ervine, pale with vexation, the next
time he met me, “but you have entirely misunderstood
my play. You can’t have stayed till the end.”</p>

<p>“It was very painful for me, Ervine,” said I, “but I
really did stick it out to the finish. Why do you young
fellows write so depressingly? You look happy enough,
<span class="nw">Ervine——”</span></p>

<p>“The close of my play is the part that matters. Bernard
Shaw said <span class="nw">so....”</span></p>

<p>We parted: he, with a look of successful hauteur; I,
broken and crushed.</p>

<p>A week or so later I met him at one of Herbert Hughes’s
jolly Sunday evenings in Chelsea.</p>

<p>“You know Gerald Cumberland, of course,” said someone
who was introducing him to people.</p>

<p>He drew himself up with great dignity and stared at me
through his pince-nez.</p>

<p>“I think,” said he, “yes, I believe we <em>have</em> met before
somewhere. Where was it, Mr ... er ... Cumberland?”</p>

<p>Shortly after, he left <cite>The Daily Citizen</cite>, and I was given
the position which he had occupied with so much conscious
distinction. I somehow think that when the war is over
and we meet, he will not know me. Ervine is very much
like that.</p>

<p>Fifteen years is a long time in the literary world, and
Charles Marriott’s <cite>The Column</cite>, which threw everybody
into fever-heat somewhere about 1902, is, I suppose,
forgotten. It was a “first” novel. Uncritical Ouida
loved it; W. E. Henley unbent and wrote a Meredithian
letter to its author; W. L. Courtney seized some of his
short stories for <cite>The Fortnightly Review</cite>; and I suppose
(though I really don’t know this) <cite>The Spectator</cite> wrote five
lines of disapproval. It was a brilliant book; fresh,
<a name="png.135" id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>original, provocative. It promised a lot: it promised too
much; the author has since written many distinguished
books, but none of them is as good as <cite>The Column</cite> said
they would be.</p>

<p>Marriott was living at Lamorna, a tiny cove in Cornwall,
when I first knew him. He was tall, lantern-jawed and
spectacled. He was interested in everything, but it
appeared to me even then that he was a little inhuman.
He lacked vulgarity; rude things repelled him enormously,
unnaturally; he had no literary delight—or else his
delight was too literary: I don’t know—in coarseness.
Fastidious to the finger-tips, he would rather go without
dinner than split an infinitive. Since those days Marriott
has gone on refining himself until there is very little
Marriott left. Even the longest and the thickest pencil
may be sharpened too frequently.</p>

<p>Many years after I met him at an exhibition of pictures
in Bond Street. He was then almost old, tired, preoccupied.
He is quite the last man to be a journalist;
his art criticism is wonderfully fine, but a life standing on
the polished floors of galleries between Bond Street and
Leicester Square is soul-corroding and heart-breaking.
Marriott’s mind no longer darts and leaps. It moves
gently, very gently.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Max Beerbohm is not so witty in conversation as one
might expect. On the spur of the moment he has little
verbal readiness; his mind is purely literary. He bears
no resemblance to his late brother, Sir Herbert Beerbohm
Tree, one of the cleverest conversationalists I have ever
met.</p>

<p>A short, mild and debonair figure received me one May
afternoon in a house which, if not in Cavendish Square,
was somewhere in its neighbourhood. In my later
schoolboy days Max was very much cultivated by those
of the younger generation who liked to think themselves
<a name="png.136" id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>enormously in the swim. We used to “collect” Max
Beerbohm’s—not his caricatures, for they were far and
away beyond our means; but his articles. I remember
a rather startling article of his in <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> which
I had bound in lizard-skin, and a friend of mine had all
Max’s <cite>Saturday Review</cite> articles beautifully typewritten
on thick yellow paper and bound in scarlet cardboard.
Max was precious, Max was deliciously impertinent, Max
was too frightfully clever for words.</p>

<p>When I called upon him four or five years ago I had,
I need scarcely say, long outgrown my early infatuation,
for he had begun to “date,” and was safely in his niche
among the men of the nineties. But half-an-hour’s talk
with him revived some of the old fascination. He had
“atmosphere”; his personality created an environment;
he brought a flavour of far-off days. We talked quite
pleasantly of his art, but he said nothing that has stuck
in my memory, and my questions seemed to amuse rather
than interest him. His small dapper figure gave one the
impression of a schoolboy who had grown a little tired,
who had prematurely developed his talents, and who had
just fallen short of winning a big prize.</p>

<p>He led the way to the front door, shook me by the hand,
looked at me meditatively for a moment, smiled faintly,
and ... vanished.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Of Israel Zangwill I can give only an impression. I
see him now as I saw him one hot afternoon at his rooms
in the Temple. A dark man, a spare man, a man very
much in earnest and anxious to be just. He was perspiring
slightly, I remember, and he bent forward a little so
as to hear and understand every word I said. I had a
request to make: a favour to ask. He listened patiently,
gave me a cup of tea, and stirred his own. For a little
he ruminated. Then he turned to me and lifted his eyebrows—lifted
his eyebrows rather high. I repeated my
<a name="png.137" id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>request, giving further details. I was a little confused.
He studied my confusion, not cruelly, but in the way that
a trained observer studies everything that comes under
his notice. Then: “Ye-es,” he said; “I see. I see.”
And then there was a minute’s silence.</p>

<p>“I will do what you want,” he remarked, at length.
“I will do it willingly—most willingly.”</p>

<p>And he did. Our little business entailed some subsequent
correspondence, and some work on Zangwill’s
part. The work was done promptly; his letters answered
mine by return of post. He gained nothing by
his work, whereas the paper I represented gained a great
deal.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Alphonse Courlander was one of the many young and
promising writers whom the war has killed. He was one
of the most hard-working journalists in Fleet Street, and
if he was not precisely brilliant, he had unusual gifts and
used them to good purpose. I could never read his novels,
but I understand they met with a certain success, and
people whose opinion I respect have spoken highly of
them.</p>

<p>He represented <cite>The Daily Express</cite> in Paris at the time
the war broke out. He was the most conscientious of
men, and he grappled with the extra work that grew up
with the war with a fierce and fanatical energy. He
overworked himself, and the horror of the war appears to
have got on his nerves. He disappeared from Paris and
was found wandering alone in London, neurasthenic,
beaten, purposeless. A week or two later he died.</p>

<p>Courlander was a good example of a not unusual type
of man one frequently meets in Fleet Street—a type that,
in the end, is bound to meet either failure or tragedy.
He was too highly strung for the rigours of the game:
too sensitive; too ambitious for his weak frame. The
type either takes to drink or wears itself out long before
<a name="png.138" id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>middle age. Courlander was an abstemious man; perhaps
if he had “let himself go” occasionally, he would have
stood the strain of his work better. When I saw him,
he was always busy, always up to date, always writing
or going to write a novel in his spare time. He had very
little inventive faculty and used to worry over his plots
and worry his friends over them. “Plots! ... as if
plots matter if you have anything to say!” I used to
urge. And then he would look at me, mystified.</p>

<p>“But, Cumberland, what can you know about it?
You have never written a novel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have,” I would reply, “but no one will
publish them.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s the reason.”</p>

<p>And he really believed that that <em>was</em> the reason.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Ivan Heald was a colleague of Courlander—a colleague
any man in Fleet Street would have been glad to possess.
Heald was original, and he created a record in so far as he
was the first and, so far as I know, the only man to be
employed by a British daily paper to write a “funny
story” each day. He made a wide reputation, a reputation
that, no doubt, pleased him, but he had no real
ambition. People who “got on” rather amused him—that
is to say, if their success was won at the expense of
experience of life. I never met a man more full of zest
for life, a man more eager for experience, a man who
retained his youth so successfully. He was vivid, careless,
tolerant and, in spite of every appearance to the
contrary, essentially serious-minded. It was the simple
pleasures of life that attracted him.</p>

<p>He had no scholarship, but his mind was well ordered,
and his appreciation of natural and artistic beauty was
of the keenest.</p>

<p>I remember that when we were holidaying together at
Oxford he would become almost angry with me because I
<a name="png.139" id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>could not immediately perceive the beauty of certain
lines—the outlines of trees, the curve of a table-napkin,
the pattern made by the ropes of a tent, and so on.</p>

<p>“You should get Eddie or Norman Morrow to go a
walk with you,” he said. “<em>They</em> would make you see
things.”</p>

<p>He loved folk-songs, Irish peasants, the plays of Synge,
the Russian Ballet, the Thames, the homely comfort of
a country inn. His feeling for family life was strong,
and Friday evenings at the Healds’, where one met his
mother and sisters, as clever if not so vivid as he himself,
were one of the great recurring pleasures of many men’s
lives.</p>

<p>He was wounded in Gallipoli, nursed back to health,
transferred to the R.F.C., and died (in all probability, for
the exact manner of his death is not certainly known) in
the air. A death he would have desired. But Ivan
Heald should not have died, and sometimes I am tempted
to think that he still lives, that something in him still
lives—something that was rich and strange and beautiful.
The other day I came across one of the little notes he used
to scribble to me. It is written from Ireland, and because
it is so like him I give it here:</p>

<p>Dixon Scott used to throw me into little ecstasies by
his reviews in <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, and I often used
to wonder if I should meet him. Our paths crossed for a
brief minute not long before we left England—he to meet
his death in France, and I to sit and wait in Serbia. It
was at the end of one of my evenings in the Café Royal,
where one used to sip absinthe, smoke a cigar, and listen
to Orage. It was “Time, gentlemen, please”: 12-30 <span class="allsc">A.M.</span>:
in Army parlance, 0030 hours. We were all very merry as
we crowded into Regent Street, and I heard a voice behind
me say: “Dixon Scott.”</p>

<p>I turned round immediately.</p>

<p>“Are you Dixon Scott?” I asked a man—a man
who looked as unlike my preconceived picture of him as
possible.</p>

<p>“Yes, and someone has just told me you are Gerald
Cumberland.”</p>

<p>“How awfully jolly,” said I, “for now I have the
opportunity of telling you how much I admire your
wonderful genius.”</p>

<p>“Tophole!” said he. “I love praise, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ra-<em>ther</em>!” said I.</p>

<p>And then I fought for a taxi and saw Scott no more.</p>

<p>Barry Pain, like the gentleman who used to be known
as Adrian Ross, leads a double intellectual life. He earns
<a name="png.141" id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his bread by writing humorous literature; he is the king
of modern jesters; but secretly (and perhaps in shame) he
studies philosophy and metaphysics and is known to have
written a big two-volume work dealing with the furtive
processes of the human mind. He is a scholar, but Fate
has made of him a manufacturer of jokes. While his
tougher intellectual faculties are wrestling with the basic
problems of the universe—the whence, whither and why
of things—his observing eye is noting the little discrepancies
of life, the jolly frailties of human nature, the
absurdities of our everyday existence.</p>

<p>He revealed little of his capacity for humour when he
entertained me to whisky and soda at his club. I found
a big, bearded and rather fleshy man rolling about in a
very easy chair. I had been sent to interview him by one
of those very pushing newspapers that, in the Silly Season
especially, run absurd “stories.” I have not the slightest
recollection of the particular story that took me to Barry
Pain, but I am perfectly certain that it was preposterous,
and I am perfectly certain that my news editor—he was
Stanley Bishop, of blessed memory—expected me to
bring back to the office several gems of humour tempted
from the brain and stolen from the lips of the famous
writer. But Pain was coy. Perhaps he does not believe
in giving away jokes for which coin of the realm is usually
paid.</p>

<p>I presented my “story” to him and tried to make him
talk about it, but he looked glum and stared stonily into
the empty fire-grate.</p>

<p>“Really,” he began, at length, “I can’t think of anything
to say. Can you? If you can think of something
very clever, put it in your article and say I said it.
Yes, do say I said it. But, of course, it must be very
clever.”</p>

<p>And he lapsed into a long, depressed silence. I was
very glad when a friend of his popped his head into the
<a name="png.142" id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]

I rose hastily and escaped.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more picturesque figure
than R. B. Cunninghame Graham. I always picture him
sitting on a bare-backed Mexican steed, his shirt open at
the throat, a long whip in one hand, a lasso in the other,
his eyes, like Blake’s tiger, burning bright, his boots
fantastically spurred, his hat flapping in the wind, and
his steed galloping <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ventre à terre</i>. In South and Central
America, no doubt, he does run wild, but in London of late
years he has always been most respectable. And yet
even West End respectability cannot kill his picturesqueness.
He has a shining mind, and everything he says is
youthful and spirited.</p>

<p>Most of his literary enthusiasms are for the younger—the
youngest—generation, but as his mind is essentially
uncritical and impulsive, his judgments are not very
trustworthy. I remember his praising unreservedly a
young alleged poet who in recent years has made himself
known by his scholarship and impudence, and, as far as
I could gather, it was chiefly his impudence that had
attracted Cunninghame Graham.</p>

 />MUSICAL CRITICS</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Not</span> until quite recently has musical criticism been
taken seriously either by the London or provincial
Press. In the old days of the sixties,
when Wagner came to London (I am writing many miles
away from books, but surely it was in the sixties that
Wagner visited us?), there was not a single open-minded
musical critic on the British Press. J. W. Davison, the
very powerful <cite>Times</cite> critic, was not only a fool, but, what
is much more dangerous, he was a learned fool. He
treated Wagner shamefully, and he did more than his
share to bring our country into musical disrepute among
the cultured men of other nations. Joseph Bennett, of
<cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite>, was a fluent writer who contrived to
say less in a full column than a man like Ernest Newman
or R. A. Streatfeild or Samuel Langford can say in a couple
of lines. He footled gaily for many years, wielded
enormous power, and did nothing whatever to advance
the cause of music in England.</p>

<p>As a commercial asset, Joseph Bennett must have been
invaluable to the proprietors of <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite>.
For, like Davison, he had great influence. People read
him. Even in my own time, when an important new work
was produced, we used to question each other: “What
does Old Joe say?” And, most unfortunately, it
mattered a great deal what Old Joe did say, though
anyone who knew much about music was very well aware
that nine times out of ten Bennett would be wrong. If
he damned a work—well, that work <em>was</em> damned. No
<a name="png.144" id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>musical critic to-day wields such power as his, though
there are at least a score of writers on music who have ten
times his gifts. His present successor, for example, Mr Robin Legge, is incomparably a finer musician, a much
more open-minded man, and a student of infinitely more
culture, than Bennett. Yet his influence, I imagine, is
not so great as that of his predecessor. One cannot say
that Bennett stooped to his public, for Bennett could not
stoop; if he <em>had</em> stooped, he would have disappeared
altogether. No: he <em>was</em> the public: the people: the
common people. He had the point of view of the man in
the back street.</p>

<p>But to-day things are changed. The musical critic is
no longer primarily a raconteur, a gossiper, a chatterer.
As a rule, he is a man of culture, of experience, of solid
musical attainments. He earns little—anything from
one hundred and fifty pounds to five hundred pounds a
year, though, no doubt, in very rare instances, he may be
paid more than the latter figure. Musical criticism, therefore,
is not a profession that seduces the ambitious man,
for the ambitious man of materialistic views may more
easily earn three times what the Press has to offer him
by selling imitation jewellery or doing anything else that
money-making people do. When E. A. Baughan, now
dramatic critic of <cite>The Daily News</cite>, was editing <cite>The Musical
Standard</cite> more than twenty years ago, he wrote me a very
earnest letter beseeching me not to become a musical
critic on account of the payment being so meagre. “If
you have a desk, stick to it; if you are a commercial
traveller, remain a commercial traveller” was his advice
in essence. But I would rather be a musical critic on one
hundred and fifty pounds a year than a stockbroker earning
fifteen hundred pounds. I love money, but I love
music and journalism more, and the three years I spent in
Manchester with an income of three hundred pounds
were full of happiness, brimful of great days when I
<a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>145<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>felt my mind growing and my spirit taking unto itself
wings.</p>

<p>E. A. Baughan is not, I think, a musician in the true
sense of the word, nor does he claim to be, but I imagine
that, being musical and having the itch for writing, he
took the first journalistic work that offered itself. That
work was the editing of <cite>The Musical Standard</cite>. Subsequently
he went to <cite>The Morning Leader</cite> as musical critic,
and then to <cite>The Daily News</cite> as dramatic critic. He is sane,
level-headed, honest, but not conspicuously brilliant. His
musical work, judged by a high standard, was poor. He
had not sufficient knowledge to guide him to a right
judgment when faced by a new problem. Hugo Wolf was
such a problem, and if ever Baughan reads now what he
wrote about Hugo Wolf some fifteen years ago, he must,
I imagine, tingle with shame to the tips of his toes.</p>

<p>As a dramatic critic he has secured an honourable and
enviable position. I used to meet him very frequently at
first nights, and always thought him a trifle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> and
almost wholly devoid of imagination, subtlety and true
artistic feeling. He has not the artist’s attitude towards
life, and he would probably bring an action for slander
against you if you said he had.</p>

<p>I was never introduced to C. L. Graves, the musical
critic of <cite>The Spectator</cite> and the well-known humorous
writer, but on one occasion I sat next to him at a very
important concert, and in conversation found him an
extremely courteous but rather baffled man. His knowledge
of music is that of the cultured amateur. His mind
but grudgingly admits “advanced” work, and I, as a
modern, regret that an intellect so charming, so gracious,
so able, should be even occasionally occupied in passing
judgment on work that has its being entirely outside his
mental horizon. But I doubt very much if <cite>The Spectator</cite>
has any influence on the musical life of London, though I
<a name="png.146" id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>imagine that Dr Brewer, Mr T. H. Noble, Sir Hubert
Parry, Sir Charles V. Stanford and Sir Alexander
Mackenzie read Mr Graves with regularity and approval.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>But the man whom all of us who write about music
honour most of all is Ernest Newman, of <cite>The Birmingham
Daily Post</cite>. Here we have a first-rate intellect functioning
with absolute sureness and with almost fierce rapidity.
As a scholar, no man is better equipped; as a writer, he
ranks with the highest; for fearlessness and inflexible
intellectual honesty, he has no equal. His books on
Wagner and Hugo Wolf and the volume entitled <cite>Musical
Studies</cite> are head and shoulders above any volumes of
musical criticism ever published in our language. But
though his knowledge of music is encyclopædic, music is
but one of many subjects upon which he is an authority.
Under<!-- TN: original reads "Uuder" --> another name he has published a volume on philosophy
which, on its appearance, created something like
a sensation; unfortunately, this book ceased to be procurable
within a few weeks of its publication. Poetry,
French and German literature, sociology and psychology
are but a few of the subjects upon which he is as well
qualified to write as he is on music.</p>

<p>Why does he hide himself in Birmingham? Well, if
you are a musical critic in London, it is impossible to do
any solid work. All day and almost every day you are at
concerts and operas, and you are sadly in danger of becoming
a mere reporter. Newman’s post in Birmingham
leaves him some leisure in which to write more important
work.</p>

<p>I never think of Newman without wondering if ever he
will be given the chance to achieve the work that is nearest
his heart. That work is a full and complete history of
music. For this task he is intellectually well equipped,
but the labour in which it would involve him calls for
years of leisure. Time and again he has planned
<a name="png.147" id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>work—notably, a book on Montaigne—which, for lack of leisure,
he has been compelled to abandon. He was made for
finer things than newspaper work, and though he has made
an indelible impression on musical thought in this and
other countries, his life will be largely wasted if the latter
half of it has to be spent in writing daily criticism and
occasional articles.</p>

<p>Newman’s psychology is peculiarly complex. Though
there is a vein of cruelty in him, he is yet sensitive to the
suffering of other people. I was with him on one occasion
when Bantock told him that a certain enemy of his (Newman’s)
had just died. The effect of this news on Newman
was to me most unexpected. He started a little. “Good
God!” he said; “poor, poor devil.” And for the rest
of the evening he sat gloomy and silent. The thought of
death is intolerable to him. His repulsion from it is as
much physical as nervous. Though, on occasion, a stern
and relentless critic, he reacts morbidly to criticism of
himself. He is highly strung, imaginative, rationalistic;
he believes little and trusts not at all, loves intensely and
hates bitterly. Vain he is, also, and he clings almost
despairingly to what remains of his youth.</p>

<p>It is some few years since I saw Newman in close
intimacy, but when he was on the staff of <cite>The Manchester
Guardian</cite> and, later on, when he removed to Birmingham,
I was at his house very frequently, and a very small circle
of friends used to pass long evenings in delicious fooling.
In those days Newman could throw off twenty-five years
of his age and become a high-spirited and impish boy. I
remember one night when, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">macabre</i> mood or, rather,
a mood of extravagantly high spirits having descended
upon us, one of our company, a lady, simulated sudden
illness and death. We dressed her in a shroud, placed
pennies on her eyes and candles at her head and feet.
But in the middle of this foolery, Newman disappeared,
and when it was all over and he had returned, he was in a
<a name="png.148" id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sombre mood. It was not because we had trifled with a
terrible fact in life that he was disturbed and distrait, but
because we had unwittingly cut into his shrinking mind
and hurt it by reminding him of something he would fain
forget. Insanity repelled him in the same violent manner,
and all who knew him intimately when he was writing his
book on Hugo Wolf will remember that Wolf’s warped
and poisoned psychology obsessed and dominated him.</p>

<p>But often Newman would spend an evening in playing
modern songs to us—Bantock’s <cite>Ferishtah’s Fancies</cite>,
Wolf’s <cite>Mörike Lieder</cite>, and so on. I can see him now as,
his clever, rather saturnine face abundantly alive, he
described Richard Strauss’s <cite>Ein Heldenleben</cite>, telling us
how the music of the harps stained the texture of the music
in a magical way, like one flinging wine on some secretly
coloured fabric. Those evenings are to me among the
most valued of my life. I remember how my wife and I
used to walk home under a long avenue of trees very late
in the spring nights, the gummy smell of buds in our
nostrils, Newman’s voice still in our ears, and our minds
fermenting deliciously with a kind of happiness we had
not experienced before.</p>

<p>Those days are gone for ever: days of a recovered
youth; evenings that were romantic just because they
were evenings; nights when, in silence, one dreamed long
and long, the body sunk deep in unconsciousness, the soul
ranging and mounting and, in the morning, returning to
its home subtly changed and infinitely refreshed....
Newman opened for me a world which, but for him, I
do not think I ever should have beheld; nor, indeed,
should I ever have been aware of that world’s existence.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>I have written of Samuel Langford elsewhere in this
book, and I have little to add here. He succeeded Newman
on <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, and I recall the curiosity
with which many of us read his first articles, fearing that
<a name="png.149" id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>anything he might write must of necessity fall so far below
Newman’s high standard as to be unreadable. We were
soon reassured. Langford and Newman have little in
common, and there is no basis upon which one can
compare them. And, at first, Langford had to feel his
way, to master his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i>, to acquire some of his literary
<span class="nw">technique....</span></p>

<p>Our respective newspaper offices were situated near
each other, and on our way from the Free Trade Hall he
used often to persuade me to drink with him before we
began our work. “We shall do each other good,” he
would say. And his short, ungainly figure, with its thick
neck carrying a nobly-shaped head, would make its way to
the bar where, placing a pile of music on the counter, he
would turn to me and talk, both of us forgetting to order
our drinks, and neither of us caring for the lateness of the
hour.... Next morning, he would frequently come
round to my house immediately after breakfast, look in
at the window of my study, and wave a newspaper in the
air. I was always deep in work, for at that time I reviewed
eight or ten books every week, but I remember no
occasion on which I did not welcome him most gladly.
And sometimes I would spend an afternoon in his great
garden, worshipping flowers, and watch him as, with
fumbling hands, he turned the face of a blossom to the sky
and looked at it with I know not what thoughts. I know
nothing of horticulture, but Langford knows everything,
and often he would talk, more to himself than to me, about
the deep mysteries of his science. And, saying farewell at
the little gate, he would sometimes crush into my arms
a large sheaf of coloured leaves and flowers, wave an
awkward hand, and shamble back to his low-built,
picturesque house set deep in blooms. Though twenty
years my senior, neither he nor I felt the long spell of
years lying between us. And sometimes I am tempted
to go back to Manchester to renew a friendship for the
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>loss of which all the great happiness that London has
brought me has, it seems at times, been but inadequate
compensation.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>During my three years as musical critic on <cite>The Manchester
Courier</cite> I had some curious experiences, and to me
the most curious of them all was the persistent manner in
which attempts were made by people in Berlin to enlist
my sympathies on behalf of an extremely able musician,
Oskar Fried. It almost seemed to me that a secret society
existed in Germany for the sole purpose of getting Oskar
Fried a job in England. Letters written in English came
to me from total strangers, informing me at great length
and with stupid tautology that Fried was the one hope of
musical Young Germany. He had Ideals; he was a
Leader; he had the Prophetic Vision; he was the man
who was going to promote and lead a new Romantic
Movement. “Very good,” said I to myself, “but what
on earth has all this to do with me?”</p>

<p>I was not long in finding out. A young Englishman
resident in Berlin, and obviously deeply saturated with
the German spirit, wrote to me to say that, in his opinion,
Fried was the only man in Europe to fill the post that
Dr Richter had vacated as conductor of the Hallé Concerts
Society in Manchester. The letter arrived at a time when
various musicians were being, as it were, “tried” as conductors
of the Hallé Concerts, and my unknown correspondent
was anxious that Fried should be invited to
conduct one or two concerts. To this letter I sent a polite
but non-committal reply. I knew Oskar Fried’s name
just as I knew the names of a dozen pushing German
conductors; but I knew no more. My persistent correspondent,
to whom I will give the name of Purvis, wrote
again, sending me a typewritten copy of a book he had
written on his friend. It was a highfalutin document of
idolatry. Fried was his idol, and Purvis gushed and gushed
<a name="png.151" id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and gushed again. But the whole thing was done with
truly Germanic thoroughness. I felt that I was being
“got at,” and though I resented it, I was greatly amused.
I led him on. I was anxious to see this gushing disciple,
this seeming advertising agent, this, as it appeared to me,
wholly Germanised Englishman. So I replied to him a
second time, and one evening he called upon me. He
was a boy of twenty-one with a beard, a manner that was
intended to be ingratiating but was intolerably insolent,
and a self-assurance truly Napoleonic. He tickled me
hugely and, as I have more than a grain of malice in me, I
opened out to him, flattered him heavily, and talked music
with him. But, though he loved the flattery, he was level-headed
enough to stick to his point—that I should do all
in my power to secure for Oskar Fried the Hallé conductorship.
And he ended the interview with the astonishing
announcement that Fried had already been engaged by
the Hallé Concerts Society to conduct two of their concerts.</p>

<p>By what devious and subterranean ways this was
achieved, I do not know, but I have no doubt that scores
of influential Germans in Manchester were approached in
a similar way to what I was.</p>

<p>Oskar Fried, with his idolatrous lackey, came uninvited
to my house. They arrived at ten and left at six. I found
Fried a very remarkable man—magnetic, of forceful
personality, but with the manners and point of view of a
gutter-snipe. He asked me point-blank what I could do
for him.</p>

<p>“In what way?” I asked him, through Purvis, our
interpreter.</p>

<p>“It is obvious in what way,” returned Purvis, without
passing on the question to Fried.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “I have already written about Fried in
the papers. And, really, I have no influence. I am not
very popular with the Hallé Concerts Society people, and
if I were to begin to recommend Fried.... But, in any
<a name="png.152" id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>case, I have not yet heard your friend conduct. It is
impossible for me to recommend a man of whose talents
I know nothing save by hearsay. You see that, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t,” said Purvis. “You are a musical
critic in Manchester, whilst I am a musical critic in Berlin,
and I tell you that Fried is the man you want here.
Surely that is enough? You must take it from me. <em>I</em>
say it.”</p>

<p>I smiled and, glancing at Fried, watched his thin, eager
face, with its peering eyes which looked inquiringly first at
Purvis and then at me.</p>

<p>Purvis came next day and the day after that, and I
began to wonder in precisely what relation he stood to
Fried. When together, they seemed to be just business
friends, and it occurred to me that the long typewritten
<cite>Life of Fried</cite> that Purvis had written was merely a gigantic
piece of bluff. Finally, I decided to cut both men adrift
altogether, and the next time Purvis called I was out.</p>

<p>When I heard Fried conduct, I at once recognised his
great powers: he had undoubted genius. But he was
never invited to become the permanent conductor of the
Hallé Concerts Society. Perchance his table manners
were adversely reported upon by Dr Brodsky, or Mr Gustave Behrens, or the discreet and reserved Mr Forsyth.</p>

 />MANCHESTER PEOPLE</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">If</span> there is one thing more than another that the
ordinary person cannot endure, it is to hear a man
from Manchester praising his own city. Somebody
from Leeds may tell him how beautiful a town Leeds is,
and he will not turn a hair; he will listen unruffled to a
Liverpudlian discoursing on the peculiar glories of the
great city on the Mersey; but if the man from Manchester
wishes to be tolerated, he must never let fall a word in
praise of the place that witnessed his astounding birth.
Why this is so, I cannot explain. I merely record the
fact.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, I will not praise Manchester. I
will go even farther than that. I will agree with you that
it rains there every day, that it is the ugliest city in
Britain, that it is cocksure and conceited, that its politics
are damnable, that its free trade principles are loathsome,
and that its public men are aitchless and gross. I will,
I say, agree to all this. You may say anything disagreeable
you like about Manchester, and I shall not care.
Nevertheless, if I could not live in London, Manchester
is the city to which I would go. I have stayed in Athens,
and Athens is a marvellous city; I know my Paris, and
Paris is not without fascination; I have been to Cairo,
and the bazaars of Cairo seemed to me so wonderful that
I held my breath as I passed through them; I know
Antwerp and some of the half-dead cities of Belgium, and
in Bruges I have felt as decadent as any nasty Belgian
poet. But these places are not Manchester. They are
<a name="png.154" id="png.154" href="#png.154"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not so glorious as Manchester, not so vital, not so romantic,
not so adventurous.... But already I have broken my
word: I have begun to praise Manchester in my second
paragraph. Let me begin a third.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the centre of Manchester’s
intellectual life is the University, but this is not so. Nor
is it the Cathedral, nor the big technical schools, nor yet
the Gaiety Theatre. These things count, but none of
them precisely radiates intellectual energy. You do not
(unless you wish to be disappointed) go to the Bishop for
ideas, or to the man of business for culture, nor to Miss
Horniman for a wide and generous view of life. For
these things, and for many other things besides, you go
to <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>. In <cite>The Daily Mail Year
Book</cite>, against the entry <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>, you will
find these words: “The best newspaper in the world.”
Now, you would imagine that if <cite>The Daily Mail</cite> really
believed that, <cite>The Daily Mail</cite> would strain every nerve
to be as like <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite> as possible. But
Lord Northcliffe knows better than that. He knows, we
all know, that the best newspaper in the world is not
going to be the best seller in the world. The word “best,”
when applied to a newspaper, does not signify a newspaper
that shrieks louder than any other newspaper, that has
the greatest number of “stunts,” that lays reputations
low in the dust, that holds Cabinet Ministers in the hollow
of its hand. It signifies, among other things, a paper
whose editor will not sacrifice a single ideal in order to
increase his circulation, who has the power of infusing his
staff with his own enthusiasms, and who regards the arts
as a necessary part of a decent human existence.</p>

<p><cite>The Daily Mail</cite> once upon a time compelled the whole
of the British Isles to start growing sweet-peas. That
is one kind of power. That is the kind of power that <cite>The
Manchester Guardian</cite> does <em>not</em> possess.</p>

<p>Yet, I ask you, is there a more irritating newspaper
<a name="png.155" id="png.155" href="#png.155"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the whole of Christendom than <cite>The Manchester
Guardian</cite>? How many times have we not all thrown it
down in disgust and vowed never to read it again, only
to buy it faithfully next morning? It would sometimes
appear that every crank in England is busily engaged in
airing his crazy views in its correspondence columns.
It would sometimes appear that the three greatest highbrows
in the country had laid their heads together to
write the leading article. It would sometimes appear
that conscientious objectors were really the only generous,
manly and heroic people left in this mad world.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a true story of a man who for years has
been, and still is, on the staff of <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>.
I tell this strange story, partly because it <em>is</em> strange,
and partly because it illustrates so finely the kind of
reverence that so many citizens of Manchester have for
the best paper in the world.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago a male child was born to a worthy
and not unprosperous man in Manchester. Now this man
had one faith, one gospel, one ambition. His faith was
of the Liberal persuasion. (Why, may I ask in passing,
do people refer to Jews as men and women of the Jewish
“persuasion”? Can a man, indeed, be persuaded to
Jewry?) But to resume. His faith, as I said, was
Liberal, his gospel <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, his ambition
to have some close connection with that paper.
Being unfitted by the nature of his own talents to join
the staff, he resolved that in the fullness of time that
distinction should belong to his son. So he wrote to
the editor, thus:</p>

<!-- blockquote -->
<p class="extraspace"><span class="smc">Sir</span>,—I have the honour to inform you that last night

<p>Years passed. Harry—we will call him Harry—survived
the perils of babyhood and was sent to a school for
the sons of gentlemen, and the editor was duly apprised
of the fact. Harry studied hard, for his ambition was
even that of his father. Harry took scholarships, Harry
had a private tutor, and, eventually, Harry went to the
’varsity. In the meantime, reports passed at regular
intervals from Harry’s father to the editor of <cite>The
Manchester Guardian</cite>, who now, as nurses say, began to
sit up and take notice. He desired to meet Harry. He
did meet him. Harry took an honours degree, came back
to Manchester, and was duly installed among the blessed,
where he still is. Harry’s dream, Harry’s father’s dream,
is fulfilled. But are those reports, I wonder, still being
written. As, for example:</p>

<p>But not all the members of <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>
staff are ’varsity men: for which, indeed, one may be
thankful. The men of letters whom they admire most—Bernard
Shaw, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad and Arnold
Bennett—never even dimly espied the towers and spires
of Oxford and Cambridge. But the paper has the manner
of Oxford, though not Oxford’s intellectual outlook.</p>

though I have written scores of articles for its commercial
pages. Some of the most distinguished intellects
in the country write for it regularly—Allan Monkhouse,
whose play, <cite>Mary Broome</cite>, has not been and scarcely can
be sufficiently praised; C. E. Montague, now in the Army;
Professor C. H. Herford, whose scholarship is in excess
of his human feeling; Samuel Langford, whom I have
dealt with elsewhere in this book; J. E. Agate, whose
fastidious style is a pure delight. Indeed, nearly every
man who can write and who has something definitely
new to say will find the columns of this paper open to
him.</p>

<p>The drawback to social life in Manchester is that there
is no central meeting-place where kindred spirits can foregather<!-- TN: original reads "for-gather" (linebreak hyphen); chamged for consistency -->.
It is true, there is the Arts Club, but when you
have said the Arts Club is there, you have said all that it is
necessary to say about the Arts Club. It is true, also,
that if you stroll into the American bar of the Midland
Hotel at almost any hour of the day, you are pretty sure
to meet someone amusing; but you really can’t make
music, or rehearse plays, or play the fool (at least, not to
any great extent) in an American bar. The consequence
of this lack of a good democratic club is that all kinds
of little coteries are formed, and it is about one of these
little coteries that I wish to tell you.</p>

<p>Of course, Manchester is not London. You know that.
In London, if you don’t like one play, you can go to
another. If the music that Sir Henry J. Wood gives you
is not to your taste, you can go to hear Mr Landon Ronald,
or (if truly desperate) join the Philharmonic Society.
But in Manchester this is not so. You have either to like
the music or do without it. Well, some years ago we
didn’t like it, and Jack Kahane, talking to me one day in
a mood of disgust, casually remarked:</p>

<p><a name="png.158" id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“I’m going to kick Richter out of Manchester. We’ve
had enough of him.”</p>

<p>With Kahane, to think is to act, and within a week he
had formed the Manchester Musical Society and begun a
Press campaign against the famous old conductor. This
Society was Kahane’s new toy, and he played with it to
some purpose. We talked a great deal, gave innumerable
concerts, hired lecturers, wrote articles, and held enormously
thrilling committee meetings. Our programmes
consisted almost exclusively of new and very “modern”
music, just the kind of music that the guarantors of the
Hallé Concerts Society detested. We were all for the
new spirit in music, and some of us in our enthusiasm
liked new music just because it <em>was</em> new. In three
months Richter began to totter on his throne and, later
on, he resigned his post, and now Sir Thomas Beecham
most fitly reigns in his stead.</p>

<p>This little Society was extremely typical of Manchester.
It was typical because it was enthusiastic, because every
member of it worked hard for no monetary reward, and
because it had a definite object in view and achieved that
object. Above all, it was young; the spirit of it was
young. I have never found in London a band of young
men and women putting their noses to the grindstone
for months on end with the sole object of achieving an
artistic ideal. People in London exploit art, but they do
not work at art for art’s sake. Manchester is England’s
musical metropolis. Elgar said so ten years ago;
Beecham echoed his words the other day. I claim for
Manchester also that the level of culture is much higher
than it is in London. In proportion to its size Manchester
has during the last fifty years given to England more
writers, musicians, politicians, actors, business men,
reformers and social workers of distinction than any other
city.... But all this, I think, is a little <span class="nw">offensive——</span></p>

<p>And yet how difficult it is for the stranger to understand
<a name="png.159" id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>159<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Manchester!—and difficult in spite of the fact that
Manchester loves being understood.</p>

<p>Mr J. Nicol Dunn, who, as editor of <cite>The Morning Post</cite>
and, later, of <cite>The Johannesburg Star</cite>, did most brilliant
work, utterly failed to understand Lancashire people
when he came to edit <cite>The Manchester Courier</cite>. I think he
regarded them as a peculiar race of savages. “A wealthy
Lancashire manufacturer,” he said to me once, “will ask
you to dinner and will order a bumper of champagne.
But if you ask him for a half-guinea subscription for a
political society, he will give you a curt refusal. What
is to be done with such folk?” Dunn thought us hard
and unimaginative, incapable of seeing in what direction
lay our best interests, and utterly childish in our notions
of political economy.</p>

<p>“Cumberland,” he said, unexpectedly, one evening, “is
your father a Conservative?”</p>

<p>“He is,” said I.</p>

<p>“What paper does he take?”</p>

<p>“<cite>The Manchester Guardian.</cite>”</p>

<p>“I <em>knew</em> he did! Of course he would take <cite>The
Manchester Guardian</cite>! Good Lord! To what a strange
set of people have I come!”</p>

<p>And he grunted and went on with his work.</p>

<p>My native town is young and strenuous and guileless.
Its vanity is the vanity of the clever youngster who loves
“showing off” in his exuberant way. So young and
guileless is it that it is the easiest thing in the world to
deceive it. How easy it is to deceive Manchester is
illustrated by the case of Captain Schlagintweit, the
German consul for some years in that city.</p>

<p>Schlagintweit was an enormous German whose mission
in life it was to induce Manchester to believe that Germany
was our bosom friend, that Germany’s first thought was
to help Great Britain, and that the two peoples were so
closely akin in their spiritual aims that a quarrel between
<a name="png.160" id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them, even a temporary misunderstanding, was utterly and
for ever impossible. As I have said, he was enormous:
a great man with a fair round belly: a man who talked a
lot and ate a lot, and who, when he talked even with a
solitary companion, spoke as though he were addressing
a huge audience. He “bounded” beautifully and with
so much aplomb and zest that it seemed right he should
bound and do nothing else.</p>

<p>I met him everywhere—in the Press Club, at concerts,
at the Schiller Anstalt, in restaurants; and nine times out
of ten he was in the company either of a journalist, a
member of the City Council, or a Member of Parliament.
I never knew any man who worked so hard for his country
as he did. He distilled sweet poison into our ears and we
believed him every time.</p>

<p>I must confess I felt rather flattered by the way in
which he constantly sought my company. I thought
for a long time that he loved me for my own sweet sake,
and it was not until the, for him, tragic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> came
that I realised that it was because I was a journalist, and
for that reason alone, he dined and wined me and talked
discreetly of Germany’s heartache for Great Britain. As
I very rarely wrote on international politics, I do not
think his evil counsel had any appreciable effect on my
work, but it is impossible to imagine that his overflowing
bonhomie, his cleverness, his subtle scheming did not
greatly influence the thought of Manchester. He was
made much of by more than one member of <cite>The
Manchester Guardian</cite> staff.</p>

<p>His daughter came to sing at a concert I organised, and
it was after this concert that he so overwhelmed me with
flattery that I looked at him in amazement. I said to
myself: “You are a humbug.” But on looking at him
again, I said: “No; you’re not a humbug: you’re a fool.”
A third scrutiny, however, left me in doubt, and I said:
“I’m damned if I know what you are.” Certainly I never
<a name="png.161" id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>suspected he was first cousin to a spy, that he was paid
handsomely by his Government for his propaganda work
in Manchester, and that he secretly despised and hated us.</p>

<p>Shortly after war broke out, many things were discovered
about Schlagintweit that had hitherto been
unknown, and he was led, handcuffed, to Knutsford gaol,
but not before he had broken through the five-mile radius
to which, as a German, he was confined, and not before
he had motored through a far-off district where tens of
thousands of our soldiers were encamped.</p>

<p>I do not believe London would have been deceived by
him, and I am sure that Ecclefechan wouldn’t. Yet
Manchester was.</p>

<p>Manchester is young, ingenuous, trusting, guileless.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed (but you must have done!)
that the self-made man—and half the prosperous men in
Manchester are self-made—will frequently part with a
ten-pound note much more readily than he will with a
few pence? The economical habits of his youth still
cling to and dominate him, and he counts the halfpence
and is careless of the pounds.</p>

<p>One Saturday night in the summer, I was taking a walk
with a friend in the country ten or twelve miles from
Manchester. Our talk was of County cricket, in which
my companion—a most magnificent person, with ships
sailing on half the oceans of the world—was greatly
interested. For three days Lancashire had been playing
Yorkshire a very close match, and we knew that by now
the game would be over.</p>

<p>“We sha’n’t know the result till we get <cite>The Sunday
Chronicle</cite> to-morrow,” said X. regretfully.</p>

<p>But, five minutes later, we met, most miraculously, a
newsboy with a bundle of papers under his arm.</p>

<p>X. took a penny from his pocket, handed it to the boy,
and received <cite>The Evening News</cite> in exchange.</p>

<p><a name="png.162" id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Very sorry, sir,” said the boy, “but I’ve got no
change. I’ve got no halfpennies.”</p>

<p>X. turned to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve no change either,” said I, amused.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of annoyance, X. handed the paper
back to the boy and pocketed his penny.</p>

<p>After we had proceeded a few paces:</p>

<p>“Lancashire has won by two wickets,” he said. “I
saw it in the corner in the Stop Press news.”</p>

<p>Now, X. had great riches.</p>

<p>An incredible story, isn’t it? But it is true, and it gives
you the self-made Manchester man—at least, one side of
him—in a nutshell.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It used to be a great delight to me to see Dr J. Kendrick
Pyne walking near the Cathedral or in Albert Square, for
he used to suggest to me a bygone age and a remote place.
His short, thick-set figure used to move with the utmost
precision, unhurried, unperturbed. His plump, clean-shaven
face, his well-shaped head, surmounted by a
new silk hat of old-fashioned shape, his gold-rimmed
spectacles with the peering eyes behind them, his inevitable
umbrella, and his correct dress—all these conspired
to make a figure of great dignity, a figure that always
seemed to carry about with it the atmosphere of the
Cathedral whose organ he played for so many smooth
years. There hung about him the tradition of the famous
Dr Wesley.</p>

<p>In character and disposition also he belonged to a
different era. He never underestimated the importance
of the position he held in the city as Cathedral organist,
City organist, and Professor at the Manchester Royal
College of Music, and wherever he went and in the
execution of whatever work to which he set his mind,
his word was law. A very fine type of Englishman.
He would brook no interference from Bishop or Dean,
<a name="png.163" id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and his combative, upright spirit fought unceasingly
to uphold the dignity of his art.</p>

<p>His childlike vanity was most alluring, and I used to
love him for it and respect him for the way he clung to
his belief in himself.</p>

<p>One day he took me to the town hall to look once more
at the wonderful series of frescoes that Ford Madox
Brown painted in the great hall. When he came to the
fresco picturing the Duke of Bridgewater at the ceremonial
“opening” of the Bridgewater Canal, he pointed
to the features of the Duke, and inquired:</p>

<p>“Whom do you think he resembles?”</p>

<p>There was just a note of anxiety in his voice as though
he were afraid I should not be able to answer his question.
For the life of me I could not think of anyone who resembled
Madox Brown’s Duke, and I stood silent. Pyne
then turned his face full upon me, and again inquired,
somewhat imperiously:</p>

<p>“Whom do you think he resembles?”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed I, guessing wildly, “it is a portrait
of you!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, with naïve satisfaction, “it is. I sat
to Madox Brown for the great Duke. The portrait is
immortal.”</p>

<p>But whether the portrait was immortal because
Kendrick Pyne had sat for it, or Madox Brown had
painted it, I did not gather.</p>

<p>On another occasion he again used the word “immortal,”
but this time it was in reference to one of his own works.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he, apropos of something I have
forgotten, “I should have made a name as a writer if
I had gone in for literature, but I felt that music had
stronger claims upon me. My organ-playing will not,
so to speak, live, because the art of the executant necessarily
dies with him. But my Mass in A flat is, in itself,
enough to keep my name immortal.”</p>

<p><a name="png.164" id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>There was such innocent satisfaction in his tone, such
a bland look upon his face, that he seemed to me like a
delicious grown-up child.</p>

<p>But have not all men of genius this superb confidence
in themselves? I am convinced they have. Could they
possibly “carry on” without it? But only a few men
of genius have the courage, or the artlessness, to speak
what is really in their hearts.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>One of the “characters” of Manchester, a man who
loves being a character, is Mr Charles Rowley, who for
an unconscionable number of years has been doing
splendid educational and recreative work in Ancoats, a
congeries of slums, a district of appalling poverty. Here,
in the Islington Hall, on most Sunday afternoons, one can
hear first-rate chamber music and, as a rule, a lecture
delivered by some local or London celebrity. I myself
have heard Bernard Shaw and Hilaire Belloc lecture
there and, after the lectures, I have gone to the clean
little cottage where Mr Rowley occasionally entertains a
few chosen friends to tea and talk.</p>

<p>I do not know if Mr Rowley is a Manchester man, but
he is of a type that I have found only in that city. He is
combative and energetic; he is a little red flame of
enthusiasm. Though, no doubt, interested in and pleased
with himself, he is equally interested in local public affairs
and equally pleased with the people for whom he works.
His broad and pungent humour is just the kind of humour
the so-called lower classes understand, and his energy
of mind and readiness of wit are remarkable. I have seen
him on several occasions talking to—or, perhaps, talking
<em>with</em> is what I really mean—a huge audience in order to
keep them in good humour until the arrival of the lecturer
of the afternoon. He bandies jokes with anybody who
cares to shout to him, and he has the true democrat’s
gift—he never by a look, a word or a gesture implies that
<a name="png.165" id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he is in any way superior to the meanest member of his
audience. These rough people love him, admire him and
laugh at him. And, of course, he is able to laugh at
himself. Perhaps, all things considered, he is the most
human man I have met, and I like to think that in him
the spirit of Manchester is embodied. I do not mean
you to infer that I think the spirit of Manchester is the
finest spirit in the world, but I do believe that it is a spirit
that might well be emulated by many other towns.</p>

<p>What is that spirit? Well, Manchester has a sincere
and very proper respect for success, and particularly for
success that has been won in the face of great difficulties.
Manchester loves education and knowledge, not only
because these things are useful in achieving success, but
also for their own sake. Manchester is public-spirited,
proud of its traditions, loyal to its principles. It is
cultured—not in the super-refined, lily-fingered sense, but
in the sense that it loves literature, music, art. It is
enthusiastic about these things; it works hard to come by
them and treasures them when they are obtained.</p>

<p>One could, of course, say many disagreeable and true
things about Manchester, but as these have been said
frequently by other people, I refrain from repeating what
is already known.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter XIV: Chelsea and Augustus John"><a name="png.166" id="png.166" href="#png.166"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>166<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>CHAPTER XIV<br
 />CHELSEA AND AUGUSTUS JOHN</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">There</span> is a prevalent opinion that Chelsea is the
British counterpart of the Quartier Latin, but the
resemblance each bears to the other is only superficial.
The Quartier Latin and respectability are poles
asunder; its population does not only never think of
respectability, but it does not know what it is. Parisian
Bohemians have no use for it. They do not condemn it,
for it may suit others; for themselves, it is as useless as
yesterday’s dinner.</p>

<p>Chelsea is not in revolt against morals or anything
else; for the most part, it is quiet, law-abiding and hard-working.
Very little is demanded of new-comers; in order
to obtain entrance to that magic land, you must be a “good
fellow,” you must have personality and a real love of the
arts, and you must be a democrat through and through.
One thing is never forgiven—a reference, however remote,
to your own success. You may be as successful as you
like without creating the slightest envy, but you must not
thrust your success down other people’s throats.</p>

<p>My own introduction to Chelsea was rather of a wholesale
kind; indeed, it would be truer to say that Chelsea
was introduced to me. One evening Ivan Heald and I
finished a rather strenuous day’s work at the same time.
I had just finished my daily column of chat for <cite>The Daily
Citizen</cite> when the telephone rang. “Is that you, Gerald?
... Yes, Ivan speaking.... Finished? ... Cheshire
Cheese? Right-o! It’s now thirteen minutes past seven;
we’ll meet at sixteen minutes past.” So while he ran
<a name="png.167" id="png.167" href="#png.167"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>down Shoe Lane, I ran up Bouverie Street and we met at
the door of that caravanserai where, sooner or later, one
comes across all the bright spirits of Fleet Street and every
American sightseer who sets his foot on our shores. We
feasted and, replete, adjourned to the bar for gossip. But
there was no one there to gossip with and, presently, Ivan
said:</p>

<p>“Come to my flat and play Irish songs.”</p>

<p>“But your piano’s such a poor one. Much better come
to my place and listen to Wagner.”</p>

<p>So we jumped into a taxi and were soon racing through
Sloane Square for Chelsea Bridge on the way to my flat
in Prince of Wales’s Road, opposite Battersea Park. At
the Bridge Heald tapped the window, and, the taxi having
stopped, he jumped out on to the pathway and promptly
closed the door upon me inside.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Ivan, “do you know what you are
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you tell me, I suppose. What is it?”</p>

<p>“You’re going home in this cab to prepare your wife
for a lot of visitors. Tell her there will be ten or maybe
twenty. We sha’n’t want any food; we’ll bring that with
us. All we shall want is coffee. Ask her if she’ll make
gallons of coffee, Gerald. For the women, you know.
There’ll be whisky for us, won’t there?” he added rather
wistfully. “Now trot along. I sha’n’t be a quarter of an
hour behind you.”</p>

<p>“But, <span class="nw">Ivan——”</span></p>

<p>“But me not a single but,” he said, grinning, and
turned away.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later a taxi-cab full of strangers carrying
parcels arrived at my flat. Heald was not with them.
In answer to their ring, my wife and I went to open the
door to welcome them.</p>

<p>“Come right in,” we said. And then they told us who
they were and we told them who we were. A couple of
<a name="png.168" id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>minutes later another taxi full of strangers arrived. Still
no Ivan Heald. It was now about ten o’clock, and during
the following hour Chelsea people still kept arriving, some
in cabs, some on foot. It appeared that Heald had
routed up half the people he knew in Chelsea and told them
that he had found someone “new,” that we were just
“it,” and that the sooner we all got to know each other
the better.</p>

<p>This “surprise party”—so dear to Americans—turned
out a complete success, though half the people had to sit
on the floor. Norman Morrow, away in a corner behind a
pile of books, sang Irish songs, Herbert Hughes played the
piano in his brilliant way, and Harry Low and Eddie
Morrow, with two clever girl-models, acted plays that they
invented on the spur of the moment. Heald came in late,
armed with loaves, butter, cakes and fruit. Not until
dawn (the month was June) did we separate. I was to
meet these delightful people many, many times later, but
so casual yet intimate was our relationship that I never
heard—or, if I heard, I soon forgot—the surnames of a
few of them. We called each other by our Christian
names or by nicknames.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all the Chelsea people Augustus John is the
most interesting. We became acquainted at the Six Bells,
the famous King’s Road hostelry, and he took me to his
studio near at hand. It was a big barn-like place with a
ridiculous little stove that burned fussily somewhere near
the entrance and from which you never felt any heat unless,
absent-mindedly, you sat on the stove itself. The
studio was crowded with work of all kinds, the most conspicuous
canvas being a huge crayon drawing of a group
of gipsies. Augustus John planted me in a chair in
front of this, seated himself on another chair and stared—not
at the picture, but—at me! Now, I had been told
that John does not suffer fools gladly, and I suspected
from his inquisitorial glance that he was waiting to see if I
<a name="png.169" id="png.169" href="#png.169"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was of the detested brood. Sooner or later I should have
to speak, and I groped despairingly in my mind for something
sensible yet not obvious to say about his bold, vivid
and arresting picture. Through sheer apprehensiveness
I found nothing, so, after gazing at the canvas for a few
minutes, I rose and passed on to the next picture. John’s
large, luminous eyes followed me.</p>

<p>“You don’t like it,” he said, softly but decisively.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I do,” I answered, “or, rather—what I
mean is that ‘like’ is not the right word. It attracts me
and repels me at the same time. It makes me curious—curious
about the gipsies themselves, but more curious
still about the man who has drawn them. But you didn’t
make it for anyone to ‘like,’ did you?”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t suppose I thought of anyone at all.
There the thing is, to be taken or left, to be accepted by
the onlooker or rejected.”</p>

<p>“Quite. But to me it is not a passive kind of picture
at all. It thrusts itself on to you very violently, I think,
and it rather demands to be ‘taken,’ as you put it. It is
not like your <cite>Smiling Woman</cite>, for instance, who mysteriously
glides into one’s mind, wheedling her way as she
goes. Your gipsies assault the mind. Your picture is
quite contemptuous of opinion.”</p>

<p>He appeared to be satisfied, for he smiled; if I had
proved myself a fool, it was clear I was not the kind of fool
he detested.</p>

<p>We met often after that. I would see him two or three
times a week in the Six Bells. He used to drink beer, and
he would talk in his slow way, or listen to me, nodding
occasionally and saying just a word now and again. But
John is the least loquacious of men. His presence makes
you feel comfortable, not only because his personality is
tolerant and roomy, but because you know that if you are
boring him he will not think twice about edging away to
the billiard-room or telling you abruptly that he must be
<a name="png.170" id="png.170" href="#png.170"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“off.” Like so many very hard workers, he appears to
be an accomplished loafer. I have never seen him at
work; I don’t know anybody who has. I have never
heard anybody say: “John can’t come to-night because
he’s busy.” I expect that when the fever is on him, he
keeps at his easel night and day.</p>

<p>But perhaps you are wondering what Augustus John
looks like? Have you seen Epstein’s bust of him?
Wonderfully good, of course; extraordinarily good; but
it is rather solemn—heavy, I mean. John is not ponderous,
and he does not wear the air of a prophet, and I have
never seen him look precisely like <em>that</em>. His hair is long....
Of course, most of you will feel disposed to sneer at
that; so should I if it were anybody but John.... But
he carries it off splendidly. You know, even Liszt (at all
events in his photographs) looked frightfully conscious of
his locks, but though John’s hair makes him conspicuous,
he does not appear conscious of his conspicuousness. He
is tall, deliberate in his movements, deep-voiced, very self-contained.
His shortish beard is red, and he has large eyes
that, in some extraordinary way, seem separate from his
face; I mean, they belie it. His features are so composed
that one might think them expressionless; but his eyes
are brooding and deep and quiet. He has not the noisy,
fussy little eyes of the “trained observer,” the man who
notices everything and remembers nothing; he notices
only what is essential to him, the things that are necessary
for him to notice.... Of course, I haven’t described him
in the least; I might have known I could not when I
began to try.... But it seems to me that the essential
thing about Augustus John is the quiet, lazy exterior
which, in some peculiar way, contrives to suggest hidden
fires and volcanic energies. A Celt, of course, and the
mystery of the Celt hangs about him.</p>

<p>I think John loves few things so much as simply sitting
back in a chair and looking at people: ruminating upon
<a name="png.171" id="png.171" href="#png.171"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>171<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them, as it were; chewing the cud of his thoughts. I
remember his coming to my flat on one occasion at one
o’clock in the morning when he knew there was a party
there. His eyes were very bright and he came in rather
eagerly, and rather eagerly also he sat and watched us,
sipping cold coffee as he did so and occasionally raising his
voice into a half-shout when something happened that
amused him. But though he sat until nearly all our
guests had departed, he scarcely spoke at all.</p>

<p>And yet another evening I remember very vividly, an
evening at Herbert Hughes’s studio where, by candle-light,
we used to have music every Sunday evening and
where, in the half darkness at the far end of that long
room, one could, if one wished, just sit and look on
and perhaps talk a little to one’s neighbour. There
John sat in the dark, like a Velasquez painting, his
limbs thrown carelessly about, his head turned gently
towards a sparkling Irish girl who seemed to be teasing
him.</p>

<p>It is only now, when I have set myself to write about
him, that I realise how little, after all, I know about
Augustus John, though I have met him so often. He
reveals himself most generously in his work, though even
there he keeps back more than he discloses. But I think
that even to his closest friends he reveals very little, and
that perhaps is why so many legendary stories about him
are afloat. He has the mystery of Leonardo. One feels
that his personality hides a great and important secret,
but one feels also that that secret will remain hidden for
ever. Sombre he is, sombre yet vital, sombre and full of
humour.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Allusion to the impression that Augustus John gives of
habitually loafing reminds me that this characteristic is
typical of Chelsea. They are the most casual people in
the world, and it is their casualness that the worker-by-rote
<a name="png.172" id="png.172" href="#png.172"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cannot understand. I know a score of studios where
one could walk in at any time of the day and be welcomed
or, if not welcomed, treated with most disarming frankness.
If the owner of the studio were busy on some work
that had to be finished, he would say: “There’s a drink
there on the table and a smoke. Do what you like but,
for God’s sake, don’t talk!” Or: “Go round to the
Bells, Old Thing. I like you very much and all that sort
of nonsense, but even you can be a bit of a nuisance at
ten in the morning. It’s like drinking Benedictine before
breakfast.” But receptions such as this latter are very
rare, and most artists—because they <em>are</em> artists, I suppose—are
ready enough to throw down their work and play for
half-an-hour.</p>

<p>I always think of Norman and Edwin Morrow as typical
artists. Norman, who died almost in harness a short time
ago, was absolutely disdainful of success, or perhaps it
would be truer to say that he was disdainful of the means
by which success is usually won. I imagine him looking
upon certain successful men and their work and saying
to himself: “Only the distinguished nowadays are unknown.”
But he would say this with his tongue in his
cheek, laughing at himself, and knowing that the dictum
is only half true. He liked admiration—what artist does
not?—but people who liked things of his that he himself
did not approve of made him “tired.”</p>

<p>Of course, those people who worship success—or, at all
events, admire it—are very difficult to bring to the belief
that many artists are almost indifferent to it. “Artists
may <em>pretend</em> to care nothing for success, especially those
who have failed to achieve it,” they say, “but surely it is
a case of sour grapes?” No man except a fool, it is true,
is wholly indifferent to money, but the type of artist of
whom I am now writing is tremendously casual about it.
If money comes his way, as it has in John’s case, well and
good; if not, it can very well be done without. The artist
<a name="png.173" id="png.173" href="#png.173"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lives almost entirely for the moment, for the moment is
the only thing of which he is certain. Yesterday has gone
and has melted into yesterday’s Seven Thousand Years;
to-morrow is not yet here and may never arrive; therefore,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carpe diem</i>.</p>

<p>Norman Morrow had the kind of subtlety and refinement
that one finds in the work of Henry James. I very
rarely came away from his studio without feeling that I
had given myself “away,” that he had seen through all
my insincerities, that he was aware of the precise motives
of my acts even when I was not aware of them myself.
But, being a swift analyst of his own emotions and a
constant diver after the real motive in himself, he was
tolerant of others and very slow to condemn.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It is incorrect to assume, as many people do, that there
is in Chelsea anything of the atmosphere of Henri Murger’s
Bohemia. Nowadays, in London artistic and literary
circles, only the idle and incompetent starve. Murger’s
young artists, moreover, are absurdly self-conscious and
flabby and childish. Chelsea men and women are keen-witted,
level-headed, and experienced people of the world.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>All the faddists, of course, go to live at Letchworth, but
there are in Chelsea a few groups of young “intellectuals”
who are good enough to supply comic relief in the “between”
days when one is bored. One Saturday evening,
having been to the Chelsea Palace of Varieties and feeling
restless and disinclined for bed, I remembered that I had a
standing invitation to go to a certain studio where, I was
told, I should be welcomed whenever I cared to go. I
went and discovered a handful of young men sitting round
the fire and directing the affairs of the Empire.</p>

<p>The little group of intellectuals (all from Cambridge—or
was it Oxford?) hailed me and fell to talking about
politics, socialism, Fabianism, Sidney Webbism, and so
<a name="png.174" id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forth. All very bright and clever, and all very promising,
but the wonderful conceit of it all! Some of them were
men with brilliant university honours, but they had not
even the wisdom, the sense of proportion, of children.
They idolised Bernard Shaw and spoke of H. G. Wells in
terms of contempt. They really thought that the destinies
of our Empire were directed by the universities, and their
priggish little minds were eager to “control” the poor, to
direct their work, even to fix the size of their <span class="nw">families....</span></p>

<p>I sat silent, wondering if these men represented the best—or
even the average—that our universities produced in
immediately pre-war days. I looked at their long, white
fingers, their longish hair, their long noses, and I listened
to their drawl which was not quite a drawl, and I thought
that their conversation was, what Keats would have called
it, “a little noiseless noise.” They had brains, of course;
they were smartish and “clever.” But what are brains
without experience and what is cleverness without judgment?
These men, I felt, would never gain experience,
for they saw in life only what they wished to see, denying
the rest. Life to them was a vast disorder which Oxford
and Cambridge, as represented by them, was about to put
right. I imagine Mrs Sidney Webb and Mr Beatrice Webb
(as <cite>The New Age</cite> once so happily called them) walking over
from Grosvenor Road to Chelsea and smiling blandly, and
with huge satisfaction, at their ridiculous disciples.</p>

<p>I have described these people because, though they do
not represent Chelsea, they are to be met with there in
considerable numbers. They have flats and studios full
of knick-knacks, flats in which you will find art curtains,
studios in which there is ascetic severity and where one
has triscuits for breakfast.</p>

Mullings—Harold Bauer—Emil Sauer—Vladimir
de Pachmann</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I quite</span> forget what particular concatenation of
circumstances brought me into personal touch with
Mr Arthur Henderson, M.P., but I rather think that
when I waited for him at Waterloo Station I was acting
the part of messenger-boy. Perhaps I delivered a letter
or telegram to him, or I may have given him a verbal
message. All I remember is, that something very important
had happened, and it was necessary that Mr Arthur Henderson should be apprised of this happening
at the earliest possible moment. So I volunteered to meet
him at Waterloo.</p>

<p>We walked across the station together, and I was
depressingly aware of a rather bulky form with a
Manchester kind of face. He spoke heavily and uttered
commonplaces that fell dead on his very lips. I could
feel his self-importance radiating from him, and I gathered
that I was supposed to be in the presence of a very exceptional
person indeed. But I did not feel that he was
exceptional. There has never been a moment since I
reached manhood that I haven’t known that my intellect
is of finer texture than that of the five thousand who elbow
each other on the Manchester Exchange, and it seemed to
me that night at Waterloo Station that Mr<!-- TN: original reads "Hr" --> Henderson
would be very much at home on the Manchester Exchange.
I recollect most vividly that he bored me very much and
<a name="png.176" id="png.176" href="#png.176"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that, offering him some plausible excuse, I parted from
him before we had crossed the river, and darted away to
more congenial people.</p>

<p>A few weeks previous to this encounter I had heard
Mr Henderson give an “address” in a Nonconformist
chapel. An “address,” I am given to understand, is a
kind of homely sermon in which the speaker talks to his
audience in a friendly and distinctly unbending manner.
He seeks to improve them, to lead them to higher and
better things: in a word, to make them more like himself....
I have not the faintest recollection of what drove
me inside this Nonconformist chapel, but I cannot conceive
I went there of my own free will. I suppose that
someone paid me to go there. But my mind retains a
very clear picture of a pulpit containing a man with a
face so like other faces that, sometimes, when I examine
it, it seems to belong to Mr Jackson of Messrs Jackson
&amp; Lemon, the famous auctioneers of Boodlestown, and
at other times it is owned by Mr Brownjonesrobinson who,
I need scarcely point out, is known everywhere....
Really, I have no intention of being violently rude. This
question of faces is important. A face should express
a soul. No great man whose portrait I have seen possessed
a commonplace face.</p>

<p>The address was heavy, obvious and dull. I was taken
back twenty years to my boyhood when stern parents
compelled me to go to a Wesleyan chapel one hundred and
three times a year (twice every Sunday and once on
Christmas Day); on most of those hundred and three
occasions I used to hear exhortations to be “good,” not,
so to speak, for the love of the thing, but because being
“good” paid. Mr Arthur Henderson, Samuel Smiles
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redivivus</i>, proved that it paid. He didn’t say: “Look
at me!” but, all the same, we did look at him. The
spectacle to most of his congregation was, I suppose,
encouraging; me, it didn’t excite. I can well believe
<a name="png.177" id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that, as I stepped out of the building, I said to myself:
“No, Gerald. We will remain as we are. The penalties
of virtue are much too heavy for us to pay.”</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>One Saturday evening I journeyed to Liverpool with
twenty or thirty other newspaper men to dine with Lord
Derby. Pressmen are accustomed to this kind of entertainment
from public men, and their host generally contrives
to be exceptionally agreeable. It would be putting it very
crudely to state that these dinners are intended as a
bribe: let me therefore say that they serve the purpose
of smoothing the way for the dissemination of some propaganda
or other. To the best of my recollection, Lord
Derby had no other purpose in view than the laudable
and kindly intention of making the journalists of
Manchester and Liverpool better acquainted with one
another.</p>

<p>After dinner, various ladies and gentlemen from the
neighbouring music halls provided us with an excellent
entertainment, and I can now see Lord Derby smilingly
and courteously receiving these artists and making them
feel that they, like ourselves, were honoured guests, and
not merely paid mimes. He seemed to me then, as he
has always seemed to me, our dearly loved, bluff but
unfailingly courteous national John Bull. He is, I think,
the most British man with whom I have ever spoken—honest,
brave, resourceful, self-sacrificing, fond of good
company and good cheer, hail-fellow-well-met yet a
trifle reserved and not a little cautious, blunt but
considerate of others’ feelings. Some of us collected
signatures on the backs of our menus, but when
Lord Derby had written his name on the top of
mine I left it there alone, not caring to see other
names mingling with his: perhaps feeling that no other
name of those present was worthy to stand beneath
his name.</p>

<p><a name="png.178" id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>178<span class="ns">]<br

welcome.</p>

<p>When I see, as I frequently do, the newspapers and
reviews praising the works of Mrs Humphry Ward and
describing her as the greatest of living British female
writers, I rub my eyes in astonishment and wonder why
Miss Elizabeth Robins is overlooked. Mrs Humphry
Ward can, it is true, tell a story: she knows well much
of the behind-the-scenes life of modern politics: moreover,
she is a woman of the world with a highly cultivated
mind and a varied experience of life. But if ever there
was a woman without genius, without, indeed, the true
literary gift, she is that woman. She cannot fire the
imagination, quicken the pulse, or stir the heart. She
plays with puppets and never reveals life. Miss Robins,
on the contrary, strikes deep into life—cleaves it asunder,
disrupts it, opens it out to our gaze. She has the gift
of tragedy.... When I think concentratedly of Mrs Humphry Ward’s books, I remember atmospheres, social
environments, a few incidents, and I see dimly about
half-a-dozen pictures. But when my mind dwells on
<cite>The Open Question</cite> and <cite>The Magnetic North</cite>, I see and hear
and touch live men and women.</p>

<p>I know nothing of Miss Elizabeth Robins’ private
affairs, but if my intuition guides me rightly, she has had
a tragic life and her life is still and always will be tragic.
Her temperament is not dissimilar to Charlotte Brontë’s,
that great little woman whose sense of the ridiculous
was so great but whose power of expressing it was so small.</p>

<p>Miss Robins, as you all know, entered the ranks of
the militant suffragettes, and it was at a meeting of the
W.S.P.U. that I met her and heard her speak. In the
real sense, she has no gift of speech. When she has to
address an audience, she prepares her words beforehand,
memorises them, and then delivers them with the lucidity,
<a name="png.179" id="png.179" href="#png.179"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the passion and the eloquence of a great actress. I think
I have heard all the best-known women speakers from
Lady Henry Somerset up to Mrs Pankhurst, but though
my admiration of Mrs Pankhurst’s brave and proud gifts
scarcely knows a limit, I consider that Miss Robins
surpasses her in her power of sweeping an audience along
with her and in her great gift of quickening the spirit
and urging it upwards to the heights of an enthusiasm
that does not quickly <span class="nw">die....</span></p>

<p>Perhaps in reading this book you have not gathered
the impression that I am afflicted by a devastating bashfulness
that, always at the wrong moments, robs me of
speech and makes me appear an imbecile. Nevertheless
that affliction is mine. The more I like and reverence
people, the more bereft of speech I become in their presence.
It is so when I am with Orage, though we have
been intimate enough for him to address me in letters
as “My dear Gerald”; it is so with Frank Harris (but
perhaps you think I ought not to “reverence” him—yet
his genius compels me to); and it is so with Ernest
Newman and Granville Bantock. And when Miss
Elizabeth Robins’ hand met mine in a firm clasp and she
spoke some words of greeting, I had not a word to say.
Like an ashamed schoolboy, I walked, speechless and
fuming, from the room and kicked myself in the passage
outside.... I know this shyness has its origin in vanity,
but then I <em>am</em> vain. But I am a fool to allow my vanity
to gain the upper hand of my speech.</p>

<p>Frank Mullings!... Well, I have more than once
said that singers bore me, but if a man is bored by Mullings,
he is worse than a fool. One always has a special kind of
affection for men whom one has known in obscurity and
of whom one’s prophecies of great things has come true.
Mullings has, indeed, travelled far since those jolly days
when we used to meet in Sydney Grew’s little flat in
<a name="png.180" id="png.180" href="#png.180"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Birmingham and make music with Grieg, Bantock and
Wolf for company. A great “lad,” as we say in Lancashire:
a great fat boy without affectation, without
jealousy, without even the pride that all great
artists should possess: a generous, simple-hearted
man who is capable of travelling a couple of hundred
miles to sing, without fee, the songs of Bantock,
just because he loved those songs and wanted others
to love them.</p>

<p>He was always untidy, short-sighted, and either very
depressed or very jolly. His moods were thorough, and
they infected you. In Birmingham, in days when only
a few, and those few powerless to help, were aware of his
astonishing gifts, he was serene and happy. I remember
him, Sydney Grew and myself sitting on the floor of Grew’s
very narrow drawing-room, our backs to the wall, and
talking of our future. I was the oldest of the three,
and for that reason spoke with simulated wisdom.</p>

<p>“Only one of us is marked down for real success, and
you, Mullings, are the man,” I said. “You have the
successful temperament. Sydney here will do valuable
work, but he hasn’t the gifts that shine and blind. As for
me, I shall make the most of my small but, I really think,
engaging talent and swank about in a little circle of
appreciators.”</p>

<p>Mullings laughed.</p>

<p>“Do you really think I shall?” he asked. “Have
another whisky, Cumberland, and go on talking; you
give me confidence. And confidence is half the battle,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So they say. But haven’t you confidence already?”</p>

<p>“Well, it ebbs and it flows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>he’s</em> all right,” said Sydney Grew. “Don’t
worry about Mullings. But what do you mean when you
say that I shall do valuable work?”</p>

<p>“You’re an artist, and you’ve got personality and
<a name="png.181" id="png.181" href="#png.181"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ideas. Haven’t you often reproached me on the score
that you meet me for an hour and, a month later, see all
that you have told me in two or three articles that in the
meantime I have written for the papers?”</p>

<p>“Well, you do pick my brains, Gerald. You know
you do.”</p>

<p>“Simply because they are worth picking. And if I
didn’t, they would be lost to the world. Why don’t you
yourself write? You must write more and talk less.”</p>

<p>He took my advice, and began a career that promised
much until the war interrupted it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mullings has “arrived” and I am
longing to meet him again, for I know very well he will
be still fat and jolly, that he will still allow me to play
accompaniments for him on any old piano that is handy,
and that we shall talk excitedly of Bantock and Julius
Harrison, of the Manchester Musical Society and Phyllis
Lett, of “Colonel” Anderton and Ernest Newman, and
of everything and everybody that made those far-off days
so full of interest and so sweet to remember.</p>

<p>Harold Bauer set out to conquer the world, and has
done nothing more than arouse the interest of one or two
countries. Yet he is a great pianist. But I am told that
his personality stands between him and the real thing in
the way of success. I have sat next to critics at his
recitals who have squirmed in their stalls as he played.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I have asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know. But don’t you feel it yourself?”</p>

<p>“Feel what?”</p>

<p>“Something. I don’t quite know what. Something
indefinable. His playing is too greasy. Did you ever
hear Brahms played like that before?”</p>

<p>“No. I wish I had. I think his Brahms wonderfully
fine.”</p>

<p>Certainly, his temperament is not magnetic like the
<a name="png.182" id="png.182" href="#png.182"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>personality of Paderewski, of Kubelik, of Yvette Guilbert,
and the public is a connoisseur of temperaments. I
think I have elsewhere observed in this book that
the public collects temperaments just as a few people
collect china or autographs. Perhaps Bauer is not exotic
or orchidaceous enough. He is too “straight,” too
downright.</p>

<p>“What are they like, these Manchester people?”
Bauer asked me one afternoon before he was to play in
England’s musical metropolis.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re ‘difficult,’ I think. They know something
about music here. You are not in London now,
you know. You have reached the centre of things.”</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>“Quite. I mean it. These people really do know.
You see, for the last fifty years they have had nothing
but the best. They have a tradition and stick to it.”</p>

<p>“The Clara Schumann tradition? Joachim and
Brahms and Hallé and all that?”</p>

<p>“No, no! That is on its last legs, on its knees even.
The tradition, I admit, is hard to define, but it’s there all
the same. If you get a couple of encores here, you may
well consider that a success.”</p>

<p>“Funny thing, the public,” he muttered. “You never
know where you have it. But, of course, there is no such
entity as ‘the public.’ There are thousands of publics
and they are all different.”</p>

<p>Emil Sauer has a glittering style and had, fifteen years
ago, a technique that no word but rapacious accurately
describes. The piano recital he gave in Manchester
nearly two decades ago was the first recital I ever attended,
though I was a lad in my late teens; the occasion then
seemed, and still seems, most romantic. It is true that,
on the nursery piano at home, one of my elder brothers
used to give recitals with me as sole auditor, and that
<a name="png.183" id="png.183" href="#png.183"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I used to return the compliment the following evening,
but though we took these affairs very seriously and even
wrote lengthy criticisms of each other’s playing, our
performances were not of a high order. But one evening,
defying parental authority and risking paternal anger,
we slipped unseen from home and went to hear Sauer.</p>

<p>I think we must both have been much younger than our
years—certainly we were much younger than the average
educated boy of eighteen or nineteen to-day—and we were
in a very high state of nervous excitement as we sat in
the gallery of the Free Trade Hall waiting for the great
man’s appearance. His slim and, as it seemed at the time,
spirit-like figure passed across the platform to the piano,
and two hours of pure trance-like joy began for at least
a couple of his listeners. My brother and I knew all there
was to know about the great pianists of the past, and
often we had tried to imagine what their playing was
like; but neither he nor I had conceived that anything
could be so gorgeous as what we now heard. For once,
realisation was many more times finer than anticipation.
Only one thing disturbed my complete happiness—and
that was the notion that the pianist might possibly be
disappointed with the amount of applause he was receiving,
though, of a truth, he was receiving a great deal of
applause. So I clapped my hands and stamped my feet
as hard and as long as possible. The Appassionata Sonata
almost frenzied me and a Liszt Rhapsody was like heady
wine.</p>

<p>But all beautiful things come to a close, and towards
ten o’clock my brother and I found ourselves on the wet
pavement outside, feeling very exalted but at the same
time uncertain whether we had done our utmost to make
Sauer’s welcome all that we thought it should have
been.</p>

<p>“Let’s wait for him outside the platform entrance and
cheer him when he comes out,” suggested my brother.</p>

<p><a name="png.184" id="png.184" href="#png.184"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Very strange must that two-voiced cheer have sounded
to Sauer as, in the dark side street, he stepped quickly into
his cab, which began immediately to move away. As our
voices died, he opened the window and leaned out, holding
out to us his long-fingered hand. Running eagerly to him,
we clasped his hand in turn and, amazed, listened to the
few words of thanks he shouted to us.</p>

<p>For long after that, Sauer was one of our major gods,
and we followed his triumphs both in England and on
the Continent with the utmost interest and excitement.
When we boasted to our friends that we had shaken hands
with the great pianist, they evinced little interest in the
matter. “Why, that’s nothing!” exclaimed a Philistine;
“last Saturday afternoon I touched the sleeve of Jim
Valentine’s coat!” Now, Jim Valentine was a great
rugger player.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most exquisite and the most fragile thing
in the world at present is the Chopin playing of Vladimir
de Pachmann. For more than a quarter of a century
writers have been attempting to reproduce his coloured
music in coloured words: they have all failed. De Pachmann is an exotic, a hothouse plant. Not a hothouse
plant among many other plants, but a plant living
luxuriously and solitarily and with exaggerated self-consciousness
in its own hothouse.</p>

<p>In thinking of him, one feels that he belongs to the very
last minute of civilisation’s progress. All the civilisations
of the past have come and gone and returned; they have
worked age-long with tireless industry; mankind has
struggled upwards and rushed precipitately downwards
through thousands of years; cities have been sacked and
countries ravaged; Babylon, Nineveh, Athens and Rome
have bloomed flauntingly and wilted most tragically:
and the most exquisite thing that has been produced by
all this suffering, all this unimaginable labour, is the
<a name="png.185" id="png.185" href="#png.185"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Chopin playing of de Pachmann. The world has toiled
for thousands of years and has at last given us this thing
more delicate than lace, more brittle than porcelain,
more shining than <span class="nw">gold....</span></p>

<p>There is the rather painful question of this pianist’s
eccentricities. One can discuss them publicly for de Pachmann himself continually thrusts them on the public.
You know to what I refer: the running commentary of
words, gestures, nods, smiles and leers which he almost
invariably passes not only on the music he plays, but also
on his manner of playing it. I refuse to believe that this
most extraordinary behaviour is mere affectation: it
seems to me a direct and irrepressible expression of the
man’s very soul. It is not ridiculous, because it is so
serious and so natural. Nevertheless, it is entirely ineffective.
It does not help in the least. Rather does it
mar. To see the performer winking slyly at you when he
has, as it were, “pulled off” a particularly delicate nuance
does not give that nuance a more subtle flavour: it merely
distracts the attention and sets one conjecturing what
really <em>is</em> going on in the performer’s mind. It has appeared
to me that the pianist has been saying: “You noticed
that, didn’t you? Well, <em>you</em> couldn’t do it if you spent
a whole lifetime trying; yet how easily <em>I</em> achieved it!”</p>

<p>The large, smooth face, with its loose mouth and dizzied
eyes, is the face of a magician out of a story book. It is
not a real face. It has only one of the attributes of power—egotism.
Egotism has furrowed every line on that
countenance; it dilates the eyes. Egotism runs through
the sensitive fingers. I have stood by his side and wilfully
shut my ears on the music and fastened my eyes on his
face; but I learned nothing. I do not know if his mind
dwells aloof from all emotion, his intellect functioning
automatically—as would seem to be the case; or if,
experienced and cynical, he has the power of pouring the
very essence of his spirit into sound, laughing at himself
<a name="png.186" id="png.186" href="#png.186"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and us as he does so—but laughing more at us than at
himself, for we are deceived whilst he is not.</p>

<p>It is strange that so exotic a personality should have
a firm and unrelaxing hold on the public. He is not
caviare to the general. Villiers de l’Isle Adam is worshipped
by the few; Walter Pater cannot have more
than a thousand sincere disciples, but de Pachmann is
adored by millions. “Millions” is no exaggeration.
People are taken out of themselves whilst he plays. You
remember, don’t you? the Paderewski craze in America
fifteen years ago, when the platform was stormed and
taken by assault night after night by society ladies.
I witnessed pretty much the same kind of thing at a
de Pachmann recital in a Lancashire town; but the latter
pianist was stormed, not by society ladies, but by unemotional
bank clerks, stockbrokers, merchants, working
men and women. At the end of the concert, they flowed
on to the platform in hundreds, and surrounded the
pianist whilst he played encore after encore, smiling
vacantly the while and enjoying himself immensely,
pausing between each piece only to motion his ring of
worshippers a little farther from the piano.</p>

<p>An enigmatic creature, this; a creature who will never
give up his secret; perhaps, even, a creature who is not
aware that he possesses a secret.</p>

 /></span></span></a>CHAPTER XVI<br
 />CATHEDRAL MUSICAL FESTIVALS</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">No</span>; I’m not going to be a chronicler in this
chapter. It sounds a dull subject, I know, but
many things happened in Gloucester, Hereford
and Worcester in mellow September days that were vastly
amusing and which were not reported in the papers, and
it is about these I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>It used to be very charming to go to one of these
cathedrals early each autumn, drink cider, listen to music
six hours a day, walk by the river, have jolly “rags” in
the hotel at night, and come home again at the end of a
week or ten days. September is a tired month, I always
think ... if not tired, a little languorous.... It has
many days in which one wants to walk about just quietly,
enjoying being alive. It would be wrong to fuss and work
really hard. I suppose that in all those wonderful places
in which I have spent so many happy weeks—Worcester,
Lincoln, Gloucester, Hereford, Norwich—people ruminate
and browse at all times. Certainly I have seen them
browsing in herds in September days. I once watched
the Bishop of Hereford browsing. He stood perfectly
still and seemed to be contemplating and measuring and
gently wondering about the growth of a healthy nasturtium.</p>

<p>Everybody used to migrate to these festivals. Well,
not quite everybody ... but you know what I mean;
just the very people you most awfully wanted to meet
again and talk to and hear music with: people like Granville
Bantock, Ernest Newman, Samuel Langford, John
Coates, Dr McNaught, Frederic Austin, Herbert Hughes.
<a name="png.188" id="png.188" href="#png.188"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>London used to send thirty or forty critics, and the
provinces about the same number. And from the surrounding
towns would pour in county families, middle-class
families anxious (poor deluded ones!) to keep abreast
of the musical times (or do I mean <cite>The Musical Times</cite>?),
maiden ladies still and for ever ecstatic over Mendelssohn’s
poor old <cite>Elijah</cite>, fierce choir-masters with ideas on choral
singing, village organists who really believed that Dr Brewer was the Last Word, immaculate young men with
æsthetic fever and a decided leaning towards Elgar’s
<cite>The Dream of Gerontius</cite> (always alluded to by them as <cite>The
Dream</cite>), very “nee-ice” young ladies who when at home
played the violin, and, last of all, deans (oh yes, lots of
deans), minor canons, slim curates, parsons of all kinds,
squires without money, squarsons.</p>

<p>It was hard for us musical critics to take these festivals
quite as seriously as the festivals expected us to do, for it
always seemed incredible to us that London or Birmingham
or Glasgow should have the least desire to know how the
choruses of Handel’s <cite>The Messiah</cite> were sung in a little town
like Gloucester. Moreover, many of us were amused at
the tragic seriousness of these age-old festivals—festivals
at which, as a rule, only two new works of any importance
were produced and over which old oratorios—an impossible
form of art—hung like a heavy cloud. So we used to
amuse ourselves in our different ways, and the ringleaders
in our occasional rags were generally Granville Bantock
and Ernest Newman.</p>

<p>Almost every detail of one of these joyous occasions
lingers in my memory. Dr McNaught, the doyen of us
all, an experienced critic, a witty speaker, and a most profound
musician, was the not unwilling victim. Bantock
or, to give him his full title, Professor Granville Bantock, M.A., had brought from Birmingham two live eels in a
tank. When he bought these sturdy creatures, he must
have had in his mind some jollification or other, and when
<a name="png.189" id="png.189" href="#png.189"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>189<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I met him in the streets of Hereford (I think it was Hereford)
during the morning of the Festival’s first day, he
asked me what was the most amusing thing I could think
of that could be done with two live eels.</p>

<p>“Eels!” exclaimed I, in amazement. “Do you mean
to tell me that you really possess two live eels?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here in Hereford. One gets a little dull here
after a couple of hours, and, after all, eels are very lively
fry. They break the monotony of life.” He paused a
moment. “And,” he added rather dreamily, “they
swish their tails so busily. I suppose an eel’s tail is the
busiest thing in the world. Come and have a look;
they’re in my room at the hotel.”</p>

<p>And there they were in a tank: dark objects in dark
water, swirling about with enormous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The day passed and no amusing idea occurred to me.
Bantock conducted one of his works in the cathedral that
evening—a very important and solemn occasion, and
when we critics had left our “copy” at the post-office for
telegraphic transmission to our respective newspapers, we
foregathered in the hotel.</p>

<p>Now Dr McNaught had gone to spend the late hours
with a friend and was not expected back till nearly midnight;
it became obvious, therefore, both to Bantock and
myself, that the eels must, in some way, be made to
surprise him on his return. We placed the slimy creatures
in a washhand basin in his bedroom, poured water
upon them, and gazed down upon them with knitted
brows.</p>

<p>“It is enough,” said Bantock; “there is no need to
think of anything else. Listen.”</p>

<p>And, truly, there was a most stealthy and uncouth sort
of noise. Eels may have soft skins, but their muscles are
hard and, as they careered round the basin, one heard
a continuous smooth sound as of people going about
some nefarious business in the dark, and now and again,
<a name="png.190" id="png.190" href="#png.190"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at unexpected moments, a loud thwack would be heard
as one of the fish threw his tail upon the side of the basin.</p>

<p>Newman and Frederic Austin and one or two others
collaborated in preparing our scheme. A female figure
was made, carefully placed on the middle of Dr McNaught’s
pillow, and gently covered to the neck with the bedclothes.</p>

<p>These elaborate arrangements for Dr McNaught’s entertainment
were only just completed when the doctor himself
returned. We waited in dark corners of the corridor
for the result.</p>

<p>After an interval of a few minutes, a bell rang and a
chambermaid appeared.</p>

<p>“There is some mistake, I think,” said Dr McNaught
genially. “Either this room is a bedroom, a larder, or an
aquarium; it would be most good of you if you would
decide as soon as possible which it really is.”</p>

<p>The chambermaid entered the bedroom and we could
just hear her quiet voice as, a moment later, she half
whispered:</p>

<p>“But, sir, the room is already occupied. There is a
lady in your bed.”</p>

<p>Of course, the psychological moment had arrived, and
we strolled casually into the bedroom to become witnesses
of Dr McNaught’s embarrassment. The jape was continued.
McNaught was taken to the smoke-room,
solemnly tried by judge and jury for having murdered
a woman and concealed her body (it was at the time of
the Crippen affair), and sentenced to death. Newman
brought a hatchet from the cellar and, not long before
dawn, the mock sentence was carried out with elaborate
<span class="nw">pantomime....</span></p>

<p>“Very childish—just like schoolboys!” I hear a reader
(not you, of course) say, rather contemptuously. Yes, it
was like schoolboys, and substitute “-like” for “-ish”
in “childish” and I agree with you most heartily.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But not all our time was spent in this uproarious way.
There were long hours of talk, great talk from Langford of
<cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, a man of mature years whom to
meet is a privilege and whom to know intimately is a
blessing; witty, rather cruel, but vastly entertaining talk
from Newman; pungent talk from Bantock; and general
gossip from all kinds of people.</p>

<p>I do remember so regretfully—regretfully, because I do
not think a like occasion can happen again—an afternoon
that Langford and I spent sitting at a little rustic table
under a just yellowing grove of poplars. Langford’s mind
is spacious, most richly stored. Nothing can happen that
does not at once and without effort fit into his philosophy
of life, and though his talk is profound it is so greatly
human that, in listening to him, one feels completely at
rest. He accepts everything.... I daresay you have
noticed that many people have tried to describe the effect
Walt Whitman’s personality has had on them, and you will
have observed how they have all failed. It is an impossible
task.... And I feel that in writing about Langford it is
impossible to convey to you what he stands for to his
friends. I recollect Captain J. E. Agate once saying to
me: “I never come away from speaking to Langford
without feeling what an empty fool I am.” Yes, that is
true; yet, at the same time, you feel reconciled to your
own empty folly; besides, you know well enough that if
you were a fool Langford would not talk to you; he would
just ask you to have a drink and then he would fumble
clumsily in his waistcoat pocket to find you a cigarette.</p>

<p>Langford will never be “successful” in the worldly
sense. Perhaps he looks with suspicion on success;
certainly he has never attempted to achieve it. I imagine
that his nature is very like that of Æ, and if what everyone
says of Æ is true, one cannot conceive that anything finer
could be said of anyone than that he resembles the great
Irish poet.</p>

<p><a name="png.192" id="png.192" href="#png.192"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>It was these refreshing talks with various people that
did something to mitigate the severity of the atmosphere
of conventionality, of “respectability” in its worst sense,
that made it rather difficult to breathe freely in these
cathedral cities. Everyone wore new clothes; men perspired
in kid gloves; girls carried prayer-books and copies
of <cite>Elijah</cite>; deans were dapper; ostlers were clean and
profoundly polite; and, wherever you went, you heard
people saying that they had seen Lord Bertie and Lady
Jane, and had you noticed that the dear Bishop had looked
a little tired last evening? There was, too, about these
festivals an air as of a society function. Music, an unwilling
handmaid of charity, was “indulged” in. One
did not have music every day, for that would have been
frivolous; but one had it in great lumps every twelve
months, and had it, not because one cannot live fully and
vividly without art, but because it made a good excuse
for a social “occasion.” The music itself was excused—for
in the minds of these people it required an excuse—by
the fact that the entire festival was organised for charity,
that vice which causes so many sins.</p>

<p>I myself came into rather violent conflict with the
Norfolk and Norwich Musical Festival authorities on a
question of artistic morality. Ten or eleven years ago
they offered a prize of twenty-five guineas for a poem, and
another prize of fifty guineas for the best musical setting
of the poem. I entered the former competition and
secured the prize. My “poem” was in blank verse and
lyrics, its subject Cleopatra, and it contained the following
passage:</p>

<p>There was a little more to the same effect, and when I
wrote the stuff I thought it very fine and still think it
rather pretty. But a section of the musical Press attacked
it violently, and for a couple of months I was quite a
notorious person. I gathered from the articles and letters
that appeared that my dramatic poem was not likely
to engender music that would carry on the tradition of
Mendelssohn’s <cite>Elijah</cite>. That had been my object in
writing it. I was sick of that tradition. I wished to help
to break it.</p>

<p>One day, while the little storm was still raging, I
received a letter from Sir Henry J. Wood, who was to conduct
the Festival at Norwich at which my work was to
be given. (Mr Julius Harrison, who has since become
prominent as one of Sir Thomas Beecham’s assistant conductors,
had gained the prize for the musical setting of
my poem.) In his letter Sir Henry wrote: “Very much
against my will, I am writing to ask you on behalf of the
Committee of the Norfolk and Norwich Festival if it is
possible for you to make any alternative version of the
‘two objectionable lines’ (I fail to find them myself) in
your libretto, <cite>Cleopatra</cite>.... From my point of view, the
whole thing is absurd and ridiculous.”</p>

<p><a name="png.194" id="png.194" href="#png.194"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>194<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>I could not find the objectionable lines. I showed the
poem to a most maiden aunt and watched her as she read
it, hoping to tell by her sudden blush when her eyes had
reached the evil place. She did not blush; she simply
read the thing and said: “Oh, Gerald, how nice! I do
think you have such pretty thoughts.” So did I.</p>

<p>A few days later Mr Julius Harrison came to my aid.
The committee, it appeared, objected to “her white
breasts gleamed” and also to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div>Her lips, tired of tame kisses, parted with</div>
<div>The expectancy of proud <span class="nw">assault....</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I changed those lines, and the work in due course was performed
at Norwich, and in Queen’s Hall, London. Later
on, when my little poem was sung in Southport in its
original form, with Mr Havergal Brian’s music (for he also
had honoured me), Mr Landon Ronald conducting, the
members of the audience did not leave their seats when
the “objectionable” lines occurred; rather did they
seem to lean forward a little and listen more intently.</p>

<p>I have mentioned this incident, not because in itself it
is important, but because it so beautifully illustrates the
point of view of our Cathedral Festivals. Their “secular”
concerts are echoes of the concerts given in the Cathedral.
They hate (or else they are afraid of?) every emotion
that is not a religious emotion. They think that God
made our souls and the devil our bodies. They may be
right; if they are, it is clear the devil is not lacking in
consideration.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that our most ecstatic moments
at the Cathedral Festivals were supplied by Wagner’s
<cite>Parsifal</cite>, which Mr J. F. Runciman, in his little book on
this composer, describes as “this disastrous and evil
opera.” Only excerpts from it, of course, were given;
all “objectionable lines” were cut out. If <cite>Parsifal</cite> is to
<a name="png.195" id="png.195" href="#png.195"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be given on the platform at all—and, in view of the fact
that we seldom have it on the stage, why not?—then it
had better be given on a platform that has been erected
in a spacious and beautiful cathedral. I remember those
white voices floating down from a place out of sight near
the roof, away above the clerestory. I always used to try
to obtain a seat near some dimly stained window so that
it might for me blot out the rather bewildered or consciously
“rapt” faces of my fellow-creatures, for, in listening
to noble music, I invariably feel much greater than,
and curiously irritated by the presence of, other people.</p>

<p>And it used to be so fine to come forth from the
Cathedral at noon, step into that mellow September
English sunshine which I have not seen for nearly three
years, and walk by the river ... walk perhaps a mile
or so and come back to the hotel to eat cool meats and
cool salads and drink cool wine. It was at these times
I used to sigh and long for Bayreuth and wonder if I
should ever see the grave of Wagner in the garden of Villa
Wahnfried in that little Bavarian town.</p>

<p>It was at Gloucester, I think, that one year I was pursued
by a certain hard-working, but not very talented,
composer who, having gained a most extensive “popular”
public for his work, was now anxious to win the suffrage
of more cultivated people. Most unhappily for me, he
took it into his head that my musical criticism had some
influence in the north, and though he was quite wrong in
this assumption, I was never able to convince him of his
error. Wherever I went, lo! he was there with me.
And always under his arm was a musical score, a score of
his own composition. Something new, he assured me;
something really quite modern. Would I look at it? I
did. It was feeble, paltry and bombastic, but I did not
like to tell him so. But when he pressed me for an opinion
I said, what was near enough to the truth, that it was
a great advance on his previous work. This seemed to
<a name="png.196" id="png.196" href="#png.196"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>196<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>please him, and he took to inviting me out to lunch. If
ever I went into the hotel smoke-room for a quiet pipe, I
would invariably notice a vague but self-important figure
in the doorway, and presently would hear the unmistakable
pop that a champagne bottle so deliciously makes
when it is opened. A bubbling glass would be placed at
my side.</p>

<p>“Now, Richard Strauss in his <cite>Ein Heldenleben</cite> ...”
his voice would begin. And he would proceed to tell me
all about <cite>Ein Heldenleben</cite> and its beauties. To bewilder
him, I used to assert that <cite>Carmen</cite> seemed to me a much
finer work than Strauss’s <cite>Elektra</cite>, and, because he was very
ignorant and because he had not the slightest appreciation
of Strauss, he used to look at me rather pitifully, and
would eventually confess that he too liked Bizet more
than he liked Strauss and that, indeed, it appeared to him
that Arthur <span class="nw">Sullivan....</span></p>

<p>One day, when we were alone, he asked me if I would
write a series of articles on his works. It was my turn to
be bewildered.</p>

<p>“A series?” I asked, utterly stunned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered he, “a series. First of all, there are
my part-songs. Then there are my instrumental pieces.
Last of all, my Cantatas.” He pronounced cantatas with
a capital C. “Just a short series: three articles in all.”</p>

<p>I hesitated, but he looked at me most pleadingly. I
tried a little sarcasm, but that made him more pertinacious
than ever. So then I flatly refused, and kept on refusing,
and did not stop refusing.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said he at length, “will you put in writing
and sign what you said to me the other day about my
new work? You will remember that you said it was the
best thing I had ever done, that it was original, full of
vigour, astonishingly fresh, subtle in <span class="nw">harmony....”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, really,” I protested, “did I say all that?”<!-- TN: original has closing single quote --></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, you did.”</p>

<p><a name="png.197" id="png.197" href="#png.197"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>And then I became very, very rude indeed, and, after
that, whenever we met, we used to bow to each other most
politely and say never a word.</p>

<p>This kind of man, and there is quite a handful of them,
haunts the more important Festivals, but it must be very
rarely that one of them obtains what he desires.</p>

<p>Can you recall the most curious and most unlikely sight
you have ever witnessed? Most of us, even in the course
of a few years of a very ordinary existence, witness many
strange things, but of all the strange things I have
stumbled across nothing has been so wayward, so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, so
fundamentally silly, as the forty organists I saw sitting in
one room at Worcester. One can imagine two, or even
three, organists sitting talking together, but forty, and
fifteen of the forty Cathedral organists, seems incredible.</p>

<p>Now, you have only to be fond of modern music to feel
instinctively that a man who is an organist and nothing
else is sitting on the wrong side of the fence. In ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred he is helping to hold things
back; he hates the rapid progress which music is making,
and he has as much imagination as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox humana</i> stop.</p>

<p>Well, the forty organists were sitting and talking and
smoking, and as I looked at them and at their mild, but
worried, faces, it seemed to me and my companion that,
in the interests of art, morality and ordinary decency,
some protest should be made. And we decided that we
were just the people to make it. We could have forgiven
them if they had met together to discuss some professional
question—<i>e.g.</i> how to get their salaries raised, how to get
the better of their respective vicars, or how they could
expand their minds so as to be able to appreciate Debussy
or Ravel or even Max Reger. But they were gathered
together merely because they liked it, just for the sake
of enjoying each other’s society. Monstrous absurdity!
Could they not see how ridiculous they were? Forty
<a name="png.198" id="png.198" href="#png.198"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>organists in one room!—why, there ought not to be forty
organists in the whole world.</p>

<p>Fortunately the room was on the ground floor and the
hour late. My companion and I stepped outside the hotel,
waited till the street was quiet, and then rapped a series
of three tattoos upon the window-pane to secure silence
within. We then sang in two parts, I in a high falsetto
and my friend in a lugubrious bass, the “Baal” Chorus
from <cite>Elijah</cite>. “Baal, we cry to thee! Baal, we cry to
thee!”</p>

<p>We had not proceeded very far in this beautiful music—intended
by the dear, delicious Mendelssohn for a shout
of savagery, but really a quite charming cradle song—when
a cry of delighted laughter came from the room,
and two or three of the organists, hatless and earnest,
rushed out into the street.</p>

<p>“Come inside!” they said; “come and join us. You
belong to <em>us</em>!”</p>

<p>Too utterly flabbergasted at this invitation to make any
reply, we turned and fled, rushed back to our hotel, and
ordered whisky-and-sodas.</p>

<p>The great musician to whom we told the story next day
said:</p>

<p>“Well, once more, you see, the biters were bit.”</p>

<p>But my friend and I did not think so.</p>

 />PEOPLE OF THE THEATRE</h2>

<p class="chapcontents"><small>Sir Herbert Tree—Gordon Craig—Henry Arthur Jones—Temple
Thurston—Miss Janet Achurch—Miss Horniman</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcapB">Sir Herbert Tree</span> never met a stranger without
trying to impress him. He always succeeded.
He would take the utmost pains about it: go to
any lengths: use his last resource.... I am not now, of
course, dealing with him as an actor. We all have our
varying opinions of him as an actor. Some think he
could; some think he couldn’t.... But I am writing
of him at the present moment as a man. A showman, if
you like. As a man, as a man who “showed off” either
as a wit, a mimic, a man of the world, a superman, or what
not, he was supreme.</p>

<p>I met him in his private office at His Majesty’s in the
middle of the run of <cite>Joseph and his Brethren</cite>. He had
invited me there in order to dictate an article to me, but,
as he told me over the ’phone, he hadn’t the remotest
notion what the subject of the article was going to be.
Could I help him with any ideas? His article was for a
Labour paper. Did I know anything about Labour?
If I didn’t, did I know anybody who did?</p>

<p>In speaking to me over the ’phone, he appeared so
anxious that I began to rack my brains for a subject. In
the recesses of my meagre intellect I found the remnants
of two or three subjects, and at nine o’clock that evening
I presented myself at His Majesty’s Theatre with them
on the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p>His room was empty as I entered it. Opposite the door
<a name="png.200" id="png.200" href="#png.200"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was a fireplace and above the fireplace a mirror; on the
left of the door as you entered it was Sir Herbert’s large
desk. By the side of this, seated on a low chair, I waited.
I had not to wait long, for presently I heard a soft, rather
pulpy kind of sound coming down the passage and, a
moment later, Sir Herbert entered, wearing a long white
beard and the garments of a gentleman of the East. The
play was still in the first act, and he had that minute come
off the stage.</p>

<p>“Got a subject?” he asked, shaking hands. “So
have I. The Influence of the Stage on the Masses!
What do you think of it? Very trite, I know, but there
are a few important things I want to say. Sit here,
will you? Here you are—ink and paper.”</p>

<p>And, sitting down, he began immediately to dictate
the article. He got along swimmingly, and about a
third of the article must have been down on paper when
I heard a squeaky voice outside the door. It was the
call-boy. Sir Herbert rose, stroked his beard, adjusted
his gown, and walked outside; as he did these things
he continued dictating, his voice stopping in the middle
of a rather involved sentence when he was out in the
passage.</p>

<p>After five or six minutes, I heard the same soft, pulpy
sound approaching and, while yet outside the door, he
began dictating at the precise point where he had left off,
rounding off the sentence most beautifully. It was a
remarkable feat of memory. After a very short period,
we heard the high-pitched voice a second time, and once
more he moved dreamily away, still dictating. Again
he stopped, purposely as it seemed to me, in the middle
of a sentence, and again, when he reappeared, he spoke
the waiting word. Marvellous! He gave me a cautious,
inquiring look, as if to discover if I had noticed his cleverness.
I smiled back reassuringly. In a few minutes the
article was finished.</p>

<p><a name="png.201" id="png.201" href="#png.201"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Do you like it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Exactly the thing. <cite>The Daily Citizen</cite> readers will
be delighted. But what an extraordinary memory you
have!”</p>

<p>“Ah! You noticed that?” he said, seemingly well
pleased.</p>

<p>He began to talk of <cite>Joseph and his Brethren</cite> and, in
the middle of our conversation, Mr Temple Thurston,
looking rather nervous, was shown in. I knew that,
at that time, Thurston was writing for Tree a play on
the subject of the Wandering Jew, and as I guessed
they had business to transact, I withdrew as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>I saw Sir Herbert on another occasion, but whether it
was soon before, or soon after, the incident I have just
related I cannot recollect.</p>

<p>He was conducting a rehearsal on the stage of His
Majesty’s, and I stood in the wings, watching him. He
had recently produced a play called, I think, <cite>The Island</cite>,
by a Spanish or a Brazilian writer. It was a dead failure
and was withdrawn after three or four nights. It was to
talk of this play that I had come, and as he advanced to
the wings I noticed that he looked rather worried.</p>

<p>“What <em>was</em> wrong with the play?” he asked. “All
you critics have tried to tell me, but I’m blessed if I can
understand what you are all talking about.”</p>

<p>“To me the fault of the play was quite obvious. The
author had got hold of a good idea and the drama had
several fine situations; but, whereas the idea was poetical
and mysterious and the situations tense and dramatic,
the author or the translator had employed the most stilted
kind of dialogue, and language as commonplace as that
which I am now using. The play should have been
translated or rewritten by a poet.”</p>

<p>“Ah! It’s very strange you should say that, for I
myself had felt strongly disposed to ask John Masefield
<a name="png.202" id="png.202" href="#png.202"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to prepare the thing for the stage. I wish I had done;
but, of course, it’s too late now. But a manager can
never tell beforehand what play will be a success and
what won’t.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me. That is often said, but I don’t believe
it’s true. Some people really <em>do</em> know what the public
wants. Arnold Bennett, for example, and Hall Caine,
not to mention others. Do <em>they</em> ever make mistakes?
Has Arnold Bennett ever been guilty of a failure?”</p>

<p>“No, perhaps not. But I can’t engage Bennett as a
reader. Even if he would consent to do the work, I
should not be able to afford his fee.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But my contention is that there are
people who can and do gauge to a nicety the taste of the
public.” And I mentioned the names of two critics who
had, on many occasions, foretold most accurately the
exact length of time new pieces would run.</p>

<p>Tree was called back to the rehearsal, and he glided
away for a few moments, fluttering a handful of loose
papers as he went. He soon returned, and this time he
was cheerfulness itself.</p>

<p>“It’s going very well,” he said, referring to the rehearsal.
“It’s only a stop-gap, of course, but it’ll make a little
money. I must write to those critics you mentioned,”
he added musingly; “or perhaps it would be better if
I seemed to run across them accidentally?”</p>

<p>But whether or not he did run across either of the
critics accidentally, I do not know, for the war broke
out soon after and disrupted everything.</p>

<p>It was when I was staying in Guilford Street, Bloomsbury,
six or seven years ago, in a house opposite the
Foundlings’ Hospital, that, one morning, Gordon Craig
came into the room. He was, I think, in search of Ernest
Marriott, a most ingenious and original artist, who at that
time and for long after was doing some sort of work for
<a name="png.203" id="png.203" href="#png.203"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Craig. Marriott and I were staying at the same boarding-house.</p>

<p>When Craig’s bulky form filled the doorway I recognised
at once, from Marriott’s description of him, who he was,
and I introduced myself to him, telling him Marriott was
out.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he is,” said Craig; “but I have often
wanted to look at one of these fine old houses.”</p>

<p>And he walked round and round the room, with his
eyes on the cornice, telling me all sorts of things, which
I have long forgotten, that I had never heard before. He
seemed to have made a special study of English architecture
of the early nineteenth century, and whilst he was
in the house talked of nothing else, though I tried to lure
him into gossip of the theatre.</p>

<p>He gave me the impression of a large, white man with
hair which, if not entirely grey, was very fair. He had,
I remember, hands much plumper than one would expect
an artist to possess; his face also was rather plump.
He seemed to fill the large room and radiate vitality. He
left as suddenly and as inconsequently as he had come.</p>

<p>“How like he is to Miss Ellen Terry!” remarked my
landlord, not knowing the identity of his visitor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “now you mention it, I notice the
extraordinary resemblance. But, after all, the resemblance
is not so remarkable, for you see, he is her son.”</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>On one occasion I was sent to interview Mr Henry
Arthur Jones. Over the telephone I made an appointment
with him for the morrow, and when I arrived at his
house I found rather elaborate preparations had been
made for the occasion. Mr H. A. Jones was standing
in the middle of the drawing-room with outstretched
hand, on a table near the open window (it was July, I
think) was a tray with what one calls tea-things, a lady
shorthand typist (specially engaged for the occasion) was
<a name="png.204" id="png.204" href="#png.204"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>204<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>waiting with notebook and pencil, and a maid was carrying
into the room a teapot, and cress sandwiches.</p>

<p>The presence of the lady typist embarrassed me. She
took down in shorthand my questions and Mr Jones’
replies. Thinking it would be foolish to waste any time
on preliminary politenesses, I plunged straight into the
middle of my subject. The lady typist sipped her tea
in the awkward little pauses that came from time to time.
It was not an interview; it was a kind of official statement.
It was like the proceedings at a police court. I
felt I should be held responsible to a higher authority for
every word I spoke.</p>

<p>However, at the end of an hour a good deal of excellent
matter had been taken down, probably enough for a two-column
article. But my news editor did not want a two-column
article. He wanted a scrappy little paragraph
or, at most, two scrappy little paragraphs. Now, in
view of the fact that Mr Jones had gone to the trouble
and expense of getting a shorthand typist specially from
town, and, more particularly, in view of the fact that it
was perfectly clear that he had not contemplated the
possibility of an interview with him being used merely
and solely for a snappy little paragraph, I felt it incumbent
upon me to tell him just how matters stood. But how
could I? Could you have told him? Well, <em>I</em> couldn’t,
though I tried and tried hard.</p>

<p>When the interview was over, he arranged that the
shorthand typist should return to her office, type out her
shorthand, and send the result to me in Fleet Street early
that evening. In due course, ten foolscap sheets of
valuable and most interesting matter came along, and I
handed it in to the night-editor just as it stood.</p>

<p>Next morning, only two snippety paragraphs appeared
in the paper, and I have often thought since that
Mr H. A. Jones must have felt disgusted with the paper,
a little more disgusted with himself, but most of all
<a name="png.205" id="png.205" href="#png.205"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disgusted with me. After all, it was not entirely my
fault, was it?... I mean, he should not have taken
himself <em>quite</em> so importantly, should he?</p>

<p>I retain a very clear impression of his personality.
He was short, rather dapper, and very deliberate. He
always thought briefly before he answered a question, but
when he did answer it he did so without hesitation, going
straight into the middle of the matter. He struck me,
as he sat on a rather low chair opposite the window, as
essentially earnest, essentially honest-minded, essentially
clear-headed. His manner was a little important. He
may be said to have “pronounced” things rather than
to have spoken them. He was formally courteous. I
do not think one could justly say that he has the
“artistic” temperament, and I imagine he possesses no
particularly acute perception of beauty. There is no
emotional enthusiasm about him; he has no unreliable
“moods”; he does not think or feel one thing to-day
and another to-morrow. By no means typically a man
of this generation, and yet not a man who has outlived
his own time. It appeared to me that he had little
intuition; his very considerable knowledge of human
nature is probably based on close observation and most
careful deduction.</p>

<p>When we parted he gave me copies of two of his plays.</p>

<p>He was a man of considerable personal charm and no
little intellectual weight: a man both kindly and stern:
a man who could at all times be trusted to see the humour
of things and who, on occasion, could be cruel to be kind.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Not so very long before the war, my journalistic duties
took me to the first night of Mr Temple Thurston’s <cite>The
Greatest Wish in the World</cite>, a rather weak but quite
innocuous play given by Mr Bourchier. If the play
“succeeded,” the audience assuredly didn’t. When the
curtain went down on the last act, there was a good deal
<a name="png.206" id="png.206" href="#png.206"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>206<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of applause, chiefly from the gallery, and we who were
seated in the stalls waited a moment to discover what
the verdict of the house was going to be.</p>

<p>Now, every close observer of theatre audiences knows
well enough that among the many different kinds of
applause there is one kind that is very sinister: it is a
kind difficult to describe, but unmistakable enough when
heard: to the uninterested listener it sounds sincere and
hearty, but if you listen carefully you will catch, beneath
the heartiness, a derisive note—something viciously eager
in the shouts, something malicious in the whistles. There
was this sinister sound, a kind of ground-bass, in the
applause that followed the last fall of the curtain at
the first production of Mr Temple Thurston’s play. The
mimes had walked on and bowed their acknowledgments
when, suddenly, there arose loud cries of “Author!
Author!” Well did I know what those cries meant, and
I told myself that the play had failed pitifully. I was
edging my way out of the stalls when, to my amazement,
I saw the curtain rise once more and disclose the nervous
figure of Mr Temple Thurston. Instantly there went up
from a section of the audience hisses and boos and cries
of half-angry disappointment. Mr Thurston shrank
and winced as though he had been struck in the face,
and his exit was confused and awkward. It was as
wanton an act of cruelty as I have ever witnessed:
deliberate, heartless, stupid. This is not the place to
discuss the propriety or otherwise of an audience insulting
a writer who has failed to please it, but it is certain
that in no other profession, in no other walk of life, do
such savage traditions prevail as in the enticing and
intoxicating world of the theatre.</p>

<p>Not long after this incident I was received by Mr Temple Thurston at his flat. I found him writing, and
almost at once he began to talk most intimately about
himself.</p>

<p><a name="png.207" id="png.207" href="#png.207"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Never again,” said he, apropos of the episode I
have just related, “shall I ‘take a call.’ I cannot even
now think of those awful few moments on the stage
without a shudder. It is distressing enough for an author
to fail—distressing:<!-- TN: original splodgy --> not only because of his own disappointment,
but chiefly because of the disappointment
he brings to the actors who have done their best for his
play—without having his failure hurled in his face, so
to speak. But though I shall never again take a call, I
shall continue writing plays. I have never yet written
a really successful play, and no work of mine has had a
longer run than sixty performances. I have had many
chances, of course, but I shall have more.”</p>

<p>He then told me of his early attempts to win fame.
Like many other successful writers, he began in Fleet
Street. The work there did not suit him, and he soon
abandoned it. He married early, lived with his wife
in a couple of rooms in Chancery Lane, and for a little
time picked up a living as best he could. The story of his
first wife’s extraordinary success with <cite>John Chilcote, M.P.</cite>,
is common knowledge. That success preceded his own
by two or three years, but he had not long to wait before
his own work found and pleased the public.</p>

<p>I saw Thurston on two or three other occasions, and
found him a man avid of enjoyment, frank, a little bitter,
combative, kindly, strong, sensitive, independent. He
has a nature at once contradictory and baffling.</p>

<p>Twenty years must have passed since Miss Janet
Achurch gave her astounding performance in Manchester
of Cleopatra in Shakespeare’s <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>.
It was a performance so remarkable, so electrifying, that
the old Queen’s Theatre in Quay Street became, for
a time, the centre of theatrical interest for the whole
of England. What London critic nowadays goes to
Manchester, or anywhere else more than five miles from
<a name="png.208" id="png.208" href="#png.208"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>home, to witness a Shakespeare play? Yet they all
went to see Miss Achurch. I remember a cheeky and
brilliant article by Bernard Shaw in <cite>The Saturday Review</cite>
on Miss Achurch, another by Clement Scott in <cite>The Daily
Telegraph</cite>, a third by William Archer in (I think) <cite>The
World</cite>.</p>

<p>For myself, I saw the play seventeen times, and though
I have seen many other actresses interpret Cleopatra, I
have not known one whose performance could rank with
the gorgeous presentation by Miss Achurch.</p>

<p>All my visits to the Queen’s were surreptitious, for I
was brought up in a family that not only hated the
theatre as an evil place but feared it also. Though I
was but a boy I had a certain amount of freedom, for I
was studying medicine at the Victoria University, and
many afternoons that should have been spent in dissecting
human feet and eyes were passed in the gallery of
Flanagan’s theatre.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have been in love with Miss Achurch,
though the kind of feeling that a boy sometimes has for a
great emotional actress is more akin to worship than love.
I longed to approach my divinity, but feared to do so.
I wrote about her in local papers, and I remember a
curious weekly called <cite>Northern Finance</cite> which, for some
dark reason or other, printed, among its news of stocks
and shares, a crude, bubbling article of mine on Miss
Achurch. I sent all my articles to her and, with the
colossal impudence of youth, and driven by a schoolboy
curiosity, asked for an interview.</p>

<p>She wrote to me. Reader, are you young enough to
remember how you felt when you first saw Miss Ellen
Terry? Can you recall your adoration, your devotion?...
Those days of young worship, how fine they are!
Novelists always laugh at calf love because they cannot
write about it and make it as beautiful as it really is.
Like many other things that are human, calf love is
<a name="png.209" id="png.209" href="#png.209"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>absurd and beautiful, noble and silly, profound and
superficial. But, unlike so many things that are human,
there is nothing about it that is mean and selfish, nothing
that is not proud and good.</p>

<p>Yes, she wrote to me and invited me to visit her. She
was kind and gracious.... Amused? Oh, I have no
doubt she was amused, but she never betrayed it.</p>

<p>I used to hang about the stage door in the dark to
watch her go into the theatre or come out of it. I
scraped up an acquaintance with several members of the
orchestra, for I thought I saw in them a kind of magic
borrowed from her. Her hotel was a castle.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who never saw Miss Achurch in
what theatrical writers call her “palmy” days can have
only a very faint conception of her genius. She became
ill: her beauty faded. Only rarely did one see her on
the stage.</p>

<p>Years later I saw her in Ibsen’s <cite>Ghosts</cite> and, again much
later, in a small part in Masefield’s adaptation of Wiers-Jennsen’s
<cite>The Witch</cite>. She was wonderful in both plays,
but the grandeur had departed, the glory almost gone.</p>

<p>It is most sadly true that actors live only in their own
generation. Janet Achurch ought to have lived for ever.
She will not be forgotten while we who saw her live;
but we cannot communicate to others the genius we
witnessed and worshipped.</p>

<p>Miss Horniman is one of the many people I have never
met. “Then why write about her?” you ask. I really
don’t know, except that I want to. She was (and, for
all I know to the contrary, still is) something of a personality
in Manchester, and she was so for a considerable
period, she producing quite a few plays at the Gaiety
Theatre that were well worth seeing.</p>

<p>But she was ridiculously overpraised. She was petted
and spoiled by <cite>The Manchester Guardian</cite>, the Victoria
<a name="png.210" id="png.210" href="#png.210"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>210<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>University gave her an honorary Master of Art’s degree,
many literary and dramatic societies went down on their
knees to her and implored her to come and speak to them,
and she was regarded by the entire community as a woman
of daring originality, great wisdom and vast experience.
She could do nothing wrong. No play she produced, no
matter how sour and Mancunian, was ever condemned
by the local Press. Miss Horniman had given it, therefore
it was “the right stuff.” She knew about it all:
<em>she knew</em>: <strong class="allsc">SHE KNEW</strong>. Many Manchester dramatic
critics were themselves writing plays, and Miss Horniman
smiled upon them. She smiled upon Stanley Houghton,
Harold Brighouse, Allan Monkhouse, all critics of <cite>The
Manchester Guardian</cite>. She would have smiled upon the
plays of J. E. Agate and C. E. Montague if they had
written any. She was our benefactress, and we used to
sit and watch her in her embroidered gown as she
rather self-consciously queened it in a box at her own
theatre.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, she had a rather depressing effect upon
the city. She gave no new play that was perfectly
beautiful. She appeared to detest romance and had little
understanding of blank verse. Starting her public life as a
patron of Bernard Shaw, she declined upon Shaw’s fevered
disciples. She spoke in public very frequently, and
always said the same things. She had all the enthusiasm
of a clever business woman. Wishing very much to
make money (so she told us), she understood all the arts
of self-advertisement. But, really, Manchester was not
the place for her; it was sufficiently hard and provincial
before she <span class="nw">came——</span></p>

<p>But perhaps I am allowing myself to run away with
myself in writing down all these disagreeable things.
Yet I believe them to be true, and they must stand.
Her plays gave me several enjoyable evenings which,
but for her, I should never have had, and I can never be
<a name="png.211" id="png.211" href="#png.211"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>too grateful to her for restoring to the Gaiety Theatre
the drink licence that the Watch Committee had taken
away some years before she came. That act, at all
events, did in some degree help to make the Manchester
plays a little less like Manchester plays.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter XVIII: Berlin and some of its People"><a name="png.212" id="png.212" href="#png.212"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]<br

 />BERLIN AND SOME OF ITS PEOPLE</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">One</span> winter, about ten years ago, I went to Berlin
in the company of Mr Frederick Dawson, the
famous English pianist, who had planned to
give two recitals there. We stayed at the Fürstenhof, a
luxurious and enervating hotel where we had a suite of
rooms facing the front. In the large drawing-room that
Karl Klindworth had engaged for Dawson was a good
piano.</p>

<p>Now, music in Berlin is just a trade. Everyone plays
or sings and everybody teaches somebody or other to
play and sing. Unless you are an artist of colossal
merit (and sometimes even if you are), you will find it
practically impossible to persuade anybody to listen
to you if you are not prepared to “square” the
critics. In the season, twenty, thirty, forty concerts
are given nightly, and by far the greater number of them
are given to empty stalls. That does not matter: no
artist of any European experience expects anything else.
A musician does not go to Berlin to get money: he goes
to get a reputation. Berlin’s cachet is (or, most decidedly,
I should say <em>was</em>) absolutely indispensable for any pianist,
violinist or singer who wishes to make a permanent and
wide reputation. Before the war, Mr Snooks could play
as hard and as fiercely and as long in London as he liked,
but unless he was known in Berlin, and unless it was
known that he was known in Berlin, he was everywhere
considered but as a second-rate kind of person, a mere
talented outsider. So that it is quite within the facts
<a name="png.213" id="png.213" href="#png.213"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to say that few artists have gone to sing or play in Berlin
except for the purpose of obtaining Press notices, favourable
Press notices, Press notices that glow with praise
and reek of backstairs influence. An American, a French
or a Danish artist will go to Berlin with a few years’
savings, give a short series of recitals, cut his Press notices
from the papers, go back to his native land, and then
advertise freely—his advertisements, of course, consisting
of judicious excerpts (not always very literally translated)
from his Berlin notices. This visit to Berlin, with the
hire of a concert hall, etc., may cost a couple of
hundred pounds, but it is counted money well spent, well
invested.</p>

<p>Frederick Dawson had already paid several visits to
Berlin and Vienna, and was so well known in both cities
that his appearance in either always attracted large and
enthusiastic audiences; but, apart from Dawson himself,
d’Albert and Lamond, no other British artist or semi-British
artist had, I imagine, the power to do so.</p>

<p>I was introduced to many critics and many artists.
The critic was almost invariably a Herr Doktor and the
Herr Doktor was almost invariably a Herr Professor:
they all had degrees and they all taught. They were
overworked, “doing” five or six concerts a night and
receiving very little pay. They would dash about from
one concert hall to another in taxi-cabs, jot down a few
notes, and look down their noses; when they wished to
leave a particular hall, they would look round furtively,
gather their coat-tails together, and sidle slimly or roll
fatly to the door.</p>

<p>Some of these gentlemen, I heard, were very shady
in their dealings with young and inexperienced artists.
They plied a trade of gentle blackmail, kid-gloved blackmail,
of course, but the kid gloves contained the claws
of a hungry eagle. The following describes one of their
pretty little customs.</p>

<p><a name="png.214" id="png.214" href="#png.214"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Hearing of the arrival in Berlin of a singer or pianist
whose agent had been advertising the fact that his client
would shortly give a series of three recitals, the critic
would call upon him, express interest in his work, and
ask to have the pleasure of hearing the artist sing or
play. The artist, flattered and already sure of one good
“notice” at least, would immediately accede; having
done his best or worst, something like the following
conversation would take <span class="nw">place:—</span></p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic.</span> Quite good. But that A-minor study of
Chopin’s is, of course, rather hackneyed; you are not,
I presume, including it in any of your programmes?</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist</span> (<i>rather taken aback</i>). I must confess I had
intended doing so. But if you <span class="nw">think....</span></p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic.</span> I do. Most decidedly I do. There are in
Berlin at least ten thousand people who play it; why
should you be the ten thousand and first? Debussy,
now. Why not Debussy? Or even Busoni. Busoni
can write, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes, yes; I’m playing some Debussy:
<cite>Les Poissons d’Or</cite> and <cite>Clair de Lune</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic.</span> <cite>Clair de Lune</cite> is a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>, don’t
you think? However, play it. Play it now, I mean.</p>

<p>The artist, half angry, but tremulously anxious to
please, does as he is told.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic.</span> Oh yes; you have talent. I think, yes, I
rather think I shall be able to praise you in my paper.
However, we shall see. But there is something, just a
little of something, lacking in your style. Your rhythm
is not sufficiently fluid. It should, if I may say so, <em>sway</em>
more. And your use of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo rubato</i>.... Well, now,
I could show you. You see, I have heard Debussy himself
play that, and I know pre-cise-ly how it should go.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist</span> (<i>absolutely staggered</i>). Oh ... er ... yes.
Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic</span> (<i>having allowed time for his remarks to sink in</i>).
<a name="png.215" id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Now what would you say if I were to suggest that I
give you a few lessons—say a couple. I would charge
you a guinea and a half each: lessons of half-an-hour,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist</span> (<i>looking wildly round</i>). If you were to
suggest such a thing—of course, you haven’t done so yet—but
if you <em>were</em> to suggest <span class="nw">it....</span></p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic</span> (<i>with most un-German suavity</i>). Of course,
when I said “lessons,” I used entirely the wrong word.
What I meant was hints and suggestions. Mere indications.
A passing on of a tradition—passing it on, you
understand, from Debussy to yourself. Not everyone,
I need scarcely say, has heard Debussy play. If you were
to play Debussy as I know he should be played, you
would be one of the first to do so in Berlin, and I in my
paper should record the fact.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist.</span> I see. Yes, I do see. I think that perhaps
you are right. You believe I could—I am rather at a
loss for a word—you believe I could, shall we say
“absorb,” the tradition in a couple of lessons?</p>

<p><span class="smc">Critic.</span> I don’t see why you shouldn’t, though, of
course, I may decide—I mean, we may agree—that a
third lesson is necessary. Shall we have our first lesson
now?</p>

<p><span class="smc">Artist</span> (<i>now quite at his ease, slyly</i>). Lesson? You
mean my first “hint,” “suggestion,” “indication.”
Right-o.... Let’s get along with it.</p>

<p>They are friends: they understand each other. Within
twenty-four hours three guineas pass from the pocket of
the artist to the pocket of the critic, and, in due time,
half-a-dozen lines of praise, golden-guinea praise, appear
in the critic’s paper.</p>

<p>After all, how simple, how friendly, how altogether
right and jovial!</p>

<p>You may think the artist a fool to pay so much for
so little, but, really, you are quite wrong. It isn’t “so
<a name="png.216" id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>216<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little.” It is a good deal. Those half-dozen lines, in
the old pre-war days, would help to secure valuable
engagements not only in New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Chicago, and the scores of large towns that lie in between,
but also in London, Manchester, Bradford, Leeds;
in Paris, Lyons, Rouen, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Brussels,
Ghent, Antwerp. But not in Germany. Germany knows
better. Not in Mannheim, Cologne, Hanover, Dresden.
The secrets of Berlin were known in all the cities and
towns of Germany some years before the war, and the
playful little habits of the critics of that most wonderful
city were looked at askance ... were looked at askance ... were
looked at askance <em>and imitated</em>. And the
imitators had for their secret motto: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit.</i></p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>A beastly city was Berlin. And yet not all of Berlin
was beastly. But the artistic, the musical, part of it was
“low, very low,” as Chawnley Montague said, on an
historic occasion, of the slums of Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>But Karl Klindworth had nothing of beastliness in him.
In writing about Klindworth I shall, I am convinced,
feel rather old, and you, when reading about him, will,
I greatly fear, also feel rather old. You see Klindworth
belongs so awfully to the past. Yet he was a very great
man in his day, and there must be still in London many
people who knew him in those silly, savage days when
stupid people (and they were brutally stupid) thought
of Wagner what brutally stupid people think to-day of
Richard Strauss.</p>

<p>Klindworth was not only a disciple of Wagner’s but
he was also one of Wagner’s prophets: a forerunner.
A great pianist, also: a great conductor: a great man.
Frederick Dawson, one of the most generous-hearted of
men, took me to Klindworth’s, and said some jolly,
flattering things about me to the great musician. Klindworth
was very old, about eighty years, and, when he
<a name="png.217" id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>spoke, it was like listening to the voice of a man who
had just got beyond the grave and was not unhappy
there.</p>

<p>I egged him on to speak of Wagner.</p>

<p>“What can I say?” he mused. “Nothing. Wagner
was from God.”</p>

<p>His large eyes, two great ponds of colour in a face not
white but stained with ivory, smouldered and suddenly
burst into flame. His hands, always trembling a little,
now shook rather violently. I could not help feeling, as
I gazed upon this old man, that Wagner lived in him
as strongly as he lives in the mighty scores of <cite>Die
Meistersinger</cite> and <cite>Tristan und Isolde</cite>.</p>

<p>We sat silent. Frau Klindworth, an Englishwoman
speaking English most charmingly with a foreign accent,
folded her hands and gave a little sigh. Dawson shot
me a significant look which meant: “Keep quiet; if you
do, he will begin to talk.”</p>

<p>And for a little while he did. Without a gesture,
without a movement, Klindworth, looking with unfocussed
eyes into space, began to talk. (He spoke in
English, for he knew that I knew very little German.)</p>

<p>“No one,” said he, “who was a gentleman, I mean
no one who had ordinary feelings of chivalry, could meet
Wagner without feeling that he was in the presence of
one of the Kings of our world. Certain people, both in
England and Germany, have written stupid things of him;
they have pointed fingers at his faults, banged their fists
upon his sins. I hate those people. Faults and sins?
Who has not faults? Who has not committed sins?
You English have a word ‘uncanny.’ Or is it you
Scottish people? Wagner was uncanny. He dived
into things. Yes, he dived. And every time he lost
his body in the blue sea, he brought back a pearl. A
pearl? No: pearls have no mystery. He brought back,
each time, a hitherto undiscovered gem.... ‘Gem’!
<a name="png.218" id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>What silly sounds you have in English.... Jem....
Djem!”</p>

<p>His old mind, outworn and very weary, appeared to
cease its functioning. He sat with no sign of life in him.
It was as though a clock had stopped, as though a light
had gone out. And then, without any apparent cause,
he came to life again.</p>

<p>“Let us go to the piano,” he said, rising.</p>

<p>So we left the little room in which we were sitting and
moved to the large music-room at the far end of which was
a grand piano. Frau Klindworth, Dawson and I sat in
the semi-darkness near the door; Klindworth’s tall but
rather shrunken figure moved down the room to the little
light that hung above the keyboard. He played some
almost unknown pieces of Liszt, interpreting them in a
style at once noble and half-ruined. The excitement
of playing seemed to increase rather than add strength
to his physical weakness, and many wrong notes were
struck.</p>

<p>It was very pathetic to see this old man trying to
revive the fires within him, trying and failing; and I
felt that if, by some miraculous effort, he had succeeded,
if the ashes of long-spent fires had indeed broken into hot
flame, his frail body would have been consumed.</p>

<p>He gave me his photograph and wrote on the back
some message, and when I left him I thought I should
never see him again. But, a few days later, I saw him in
the front row of one of Frederick Dawson’s recitals, and
I occasionally heard from him a deep-noted “Bravo!”
as Dawson electrified us with one of his stupendous
performances.</p>

<p>Klindworth lingered on for some years later and, when I
was in Macedonia last year, I saw in some newspaper a few
lines recording his death. In the seventies he was a great
figure in London, and Wagner-worshippers of those days
worshipped Klindworth also, not only for his genius, but
<a name="png.219" id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>also for his loyalty, his noble-mindedness, his devotion
to his art.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Out of curiosity on the last day of my stay in Berlin,
I went to a famous concert agent’s office, ostensibly to
make some business inquiries, but, in reality, to have a
look at the underworld of art; for the business side of
all art has almost invariably an underworld of its own in
which there is much irony and in which dwells a spirit
of strangely sardonic humour.</p>

<p>The office was crowded with artists, most of them
prosperous, all of them of recognised position. Though
they were clients of the agent—that is to say, people
able and eager to engage his services and pay handsomely
for them—they were kept waiting an unconscionable time,
as though they had come to beg favours. As, indeed,
they had. For Herr Otto Zuggstein always made it
perfectly clear by his manner that the favour was his to
confer, the honour yours to accept. He had a hot, eager
brain, cunning hands and hairy wrists.</p>

<p>And his work, his object in life? Well, he was the
connecting-link between the artist and the public, just
as a publisher is the connecting-link between authors and
those who read. Otto Zuggstein “published” pianists,
singers, violinists. He engaged concert halls for them,
sold their tickets and collected the money, printed their
programmes, distributed tickets to the Press, advertised
their recitals, and so on. There are, of course, many such
men, men engaged honourably in an honourable profession,
in all the big cities of Europe; but Zuggstein
was steeped in dishonour. It was freely said of him that
he had all the powerful music critics of Berlin in the
hollow of his hand. Instead of working for their respective
editors they really worked for him. He could command
a long and enthusiastic “notice” about almost any artist
in almost any paper; he could also secure the publication
<a name="png.220" id="png.220" href="#png.220"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the most damning criticisms. If you were a really
great artist desiring to “succeed” in Berlin and he, or
his friends, considered it against his own and his friends’
interest for you to succeed, he could and would prevent
you doing so.</p>

<p>He occasionally emerged from the inner room in which
he sat, moved among us for a minute or so, exchanging
handshakes, smiles and other insincerities, and, singling
out a man or a woman with special business claims upon
him, returned with his companion to his private office.
As he disappeared, some of those who waited smiled
significantly at each other.</p>

<p>Zuggstein, as one used to write three or four years
ago, “intrigued” me. He was such an efficient rogue:
a rogue working, as it appeared, most openly, most
flagrantly, but in reality working with an abundance of
prepared camouflage.</p>

<p>I waited most patiently and, in the course of time,
when he again issued from his private sanctum, he queried
me with his right eyebrow, beckoned me almost imperceptibly
with his left elbow and, preceding me, made
a gangway to his room. I followed him with an air,
recognising, as I did so, that I was in for a bit of an
adventure, and resolved to lie like poor Beelzebub himself.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said he in English when the door
was closed upon us. “Will you take a chair and also
a cigar?” Mysteriously, he produced a box from the
region of his knees and looked hard at me. “And a
whisky?” he added, with a smile. “I never drink
myself,” he apologised, “but you English!”</p>

<p>I accepted all three invitations.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said I, when I had lit my cigar and
savoured it, “I have come to see you about half-a-dozen
recitals, piano recitals, that a Norwegian friend of mine
wishes to give here in Berlin next January.”</p>

<p>“To whom,” asked he—and a little chill descended
<a name="png.221" id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>upon him as he asked the question—“to whom have I the
honour of speaking?”</p>

<p>I smiled deprecatingly, and produced from my card-case
a card bearing the name “Gerald Cumberland.”</p>

<p>“I am staying at the Fürstenhof. Room 4001.”</p>

<p>Disarmed, but still cautious, he wrote the number of
my room on the pasteboard.</p>

<p>“I am, I think it is obvious, from England. This is
my first visit to your great city. I am interested in art,
in music.” I used a careless, all-embracing gesture.
“And my Norwegian friend, Mr Sigurd Falk, knowing
that I was about to set out for Berlin, asked me to try
to arrange certain matters with you. He got your name
from a compatriot of his.”</p>

<p>By this time he had poured out, and I had drunk most
of, the whisky. A peculiar thing happened: whilst it was
I who drank the whisky, it was he who became genial—more
than genial: almost friendly.</p>

<p>“What,” he inquired, “does your friend wish to do in
Berlin?”</p>

<p>“Play the piano and make a little money.”</p>

<p>He grunted sympathetically, if a man may ever be said
to grunt sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Money is difficult to make in Berlin,” he said, looking
at me keenly, “but I will do my best for him. Six
recitals, you say?”</p>

<p>“Six. And at this, our first interview, I wished to
have just a rough estimate of what those six recitals are
likely to cost.”</p>

<p>“Why, it all depends.... Another whisky?...
No?... It all depends. Depends on all kinds of things.
What hall do you want? I ought, perhaps, to tell you,
first of all, what hall you can <em>have</em>: you see, you come
rather late, very late, in the day. It is now November,
and your friend wishes to play in January. All the halls
are usually booked months in advance.”</p>

<p><a name="png.222" id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>We went into particulars of halls, dates, etc. And
then he began to scribble figures on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>“Press?” he queried.</p>

<p>“I <em>beg</em> your pardon?”</p>

<p>“You would, I mean your friend would, I imagine, like
a favourable Press?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p>“Audience?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean <em>any</em> kind of audience?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid they will be mostly women, though, of
course, I can get you a certain number of male students.
But the audience, I can promise you, will be well disposed.
Three or four encores at least.”</p>

<p>“Yes, then, both Press <em>and</em> audience.”</p>

<p>He scribbled a little more.</p>

<p>“An inclusive estimate?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Please. You mean by inclusive...?”</p>

<p>“Everything,” he said impressively; “the hall, the
printing, the advertisements, a few invitations, the
preliminary paragraphs, the audience, the critics’ articles.
And not only the critics’ notices, but the presence of the
critics themselves,” he added.</p>

<p>He worked hard for five minutes, looked up data in
books, and at length very gently pushed over to me, across
the shining top of the table, a properly written out estimate
for the recitals my imaginary friend intended to give.
The total amount, as represented by English money, was
£325.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” said I; “I will call to see you
to-morrow perhaps. But I must first of all get an estimate
from Herr Dorn.”</p>

<p>“Who is Herr Dorn?” he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>I did not know: his name had slid into my mind that
very moment, and I was not quite sure whether, in the
whole world, there was such a name. Then, greatly
daring, I greatly lied.</p>

<p><a name="png.223" id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“He is a cousin of Sigurd Falk,” said I.</p>

<p>As I left, he gave me another cigar, shook my hand
most warmly, and looked me in the eyes very keenly.</p>

<p>Every night Dawson and I used to go either to the
opera or to some concert, and, when the music was
finished, which was generally very late, we would perhaps
go to some supper-party or other.</p>

<p>I have a good appetite myself, but really some of the
German ladies’ gastronomic feats were superb. I remember
myself one night sitting fascinated and awestruck as I
saw a Wagner-heroine type of woman, full-breasted, high-browed
and majestic, eat plateful after plateful of oysters,
until I began to wonder how it was so many oysters came
to be in Berlin at one and the same time.</p>

<p>Elena Gerhardt, in those days, was large, white and
serene. She was a little bitter, perhaps, and certainly
greatly disappointed. I met her in Manchester shortly
after my return to England, and found her mind insipid,
her soul tepid.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Egon Petri had phlegm almost British: a real slogger:
most uninspired: the possessor of faultless technique:
the possessor of a brain that retained everything but
expounded nothing. He had business ability and pushed
ahead all the time: pushed ahead all the time, but never
arrived anywhere. Never will arrive anywhere in particular,
except at his own well-cleaned doorstep, where the
polished knocker will respond to his carefully gloved hand.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss I also met in Manchester at about the
same time. I have always maintained that, in at least
one case out of three, it is unwise to judge a man by his
face.</p>

<p>But I must for a moment digress. This question of
<a name="png.224" id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>faces is most interesting. Every man, of course, makes
his own face: even the most ugly of us will concede that
much, for, if we are, and know we are, ugly, we always
console ourselves with the thought: “Yes, but it is a
special kind of ugliness. There is strength in my ugliness.
There is character; there is soul. My ugliness is original.
There is no ugliness <em>quite</em> like my ugliness.” For, so long
as we are different from other people, that is all that
matters. Now, in making our faces—a process that is
always continuous from the time we are born to the moment
of death—some of us are full of anxiety to make, not a
face, but a mask. Our faces do not express our souls:
they hide them. The consequence of this is that you will
sometimes, though not often, meet a man with a mean,
insignificant face who is, in reality, the possessor of a
first-rate brain. But it is difficult to repress some facial
hint of intellect; try how one may, one can do little
to modify the shape of one’s brow or give the eye a sodden
and unintelligent look.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss has disguised himself. At close
quarters one sees at once that his head is both shapely
and well poised: one notices the exceptionally high forehead,
the firm rounded lips, the determined chin. “A
financier,” you say to yourself; “at all events, if not a
financier, a man of affairs, a man accustomed to deal with
and order facts. Certainly not a dreamer—not a poet
or a musician or an artist of any kind.”</p>

<p>He exhibits no emotion. Self-restrained, he speaks
little but very much to the point. Even in moments of
great success, he is reserved and businesslike. You can
never take him unawares. He is guarded, on the alert,
watchful. “All mind but no heart,” you say; at least,
you say that if you are a careless observer.</p>

<p>His tastes are of the simplest and though, for a composer,
he has amassed a large amount of money, he is
absurdly economical. He rather likes abuse, and when
<a name="png.225" id="png.225" href="#png.225"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a critic makes a fool of himself he is inordinately
amused. The spectacle of human vanity and human folly
excites him. His handshake is firm, his regard direct.</p>

<p>His piano-playing is beautifully neat and polished, but
he is not a virtuoso on the instrument.</p>

<p class="chapcontents"><small>Edvard Grieg—Sir Frederick H. Cowen—Dr Hans Richter—Sir
Thomas Beecham—Sir Charles Santley—Landon Ronald—Frederic
Austin</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Very</span> many years have passed since, one cold
winter’s afternoon, I met Edvard Grieg on
Adolph Brodsky’s doorstep. A little figure buried,
very deeply buried, in an overcoat at least six inches thick,
came down the damp street, paused a minute at the gate,
and then, rather hesitatingly, walked up the pathway.
He saluted me as he reached the door and we waited
together until my summons to those within was answered.</p>

<p>I found him very homely, completely without affectation,
childlike, and a little melancholy. He was at that
time in indifferent health, and it was at once made evident
to me that both Grieg himself and those around him—especially
Mrs Brodsky—were very anxious that he
should be restored to complete fitness. He said nothing
in the least degree noteworthy, but when he did speak
he had such a gentle air, a manner so ingratiating and
simple, that one found his conversation most unusually
pleasant.</p>

<p>Ernest Newman once called Grieg “Griegkin,” a most
admirable name for this quite first-rate of third-rate
composers. His music is diminutive. He could not
think largely. He loved country dances, country scenes,
the rhythm of homely life, the bounded horizon. Even
so extended a work as his Pianoforte Concerto is a series
of miniatures. And Grieg the man was precisely like
<a name="png.227" id="png.227" href="#png.227"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Grieg the artist. He was Griegkin in his appearance,
his manner, his way of speaking: a little man: a gracious
little man. His attitude towards his host and hostess
was that of an affectionate child. Such dear simplicity
is, I think, in the artist found only among men of northern
races.</p>

<p>Some years later, in an intimate little circle, I was
to hear his widow sing and play many of her husband’s
songs. She was the feminine counterpart of himself—spirited,
a little sad, simple yet wise, frank, and an artist
through and through.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>A great deal of comedy is lost to the world through
lack of historians. It is almost impossible to conceive
that Sir F. H. Cowen should ever have been in serious
competition with Hans Richter: impossible to conceive
that half the musical inhabitants of a large city should
have been ranged fiercely on Sir Frederick’s side, and the
other half ranged on the side of Richter: impossible to
conceive that both Cowen and Richter were candidates
for the same post. Yet so it was.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Hallé, who had founded and conducted
for about half-a-century the famous orchestral concerts
in Manchester still known by his name, died and left no
successor. Literally, there was no one to appoint in his
place, no one quite good enough. Month after month
went by, a good many distinguished and semi-distinguished
musicians came to Manchester and conducted an odd concert
or two, but it was very widely felt that no British
musician would do. Sir Frederick Cowen, always an
earnest and accomplished composer, came for a season
or two and did some admirable work, but Cowen was
not Hallé. Then the German element in Manchester discovered
that Richter would come, if invited. The salary
was large, the work not heavy, the climate awful, the
people devoted, the position unusually powerful. All
<a name="png.228" id="png.228" href="#png.228"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>things considered, it was one of the few really good vacant
musical posts in Europe.</p>

<p>All this is ancient history now, and I will record only
briefly that ultimately Sir Frederick Cowen was, in effect,
told (what, no doubt, he already knew) that Richter was
the better man and that he (Cowen) must go. But before
this decision was made a most severe fight was waged in
the city. Cowen conducted, and thousands of partisans
came and cheered him to the echo. Richter conducted,
and thousands of partisans came and cheered him to the
echo. People wrote to the newspapers. Leader writers
solemnly summed up the situation from day to day.
Protests were made, meetings were organised and held,
votes of confidence were passed. London caught the
infection, and passed its opinion, its <span class="nw">opinions....</span></p>

<p>Sir F. H. Cowen (he was “Mr” then) received me in
his rooms at the Manchester Grand Hotel. It was impossible
not to like him, for, if he had no great positive
qualities that seized upon you at once, he had a good
many negative ones. He had no “side,” no self-importance,
no eccentricities. He had neither long hair nor a
foreign accent. He did not use a cigarette-holder. He
did not loll when he sat down, or posture when he stood
up. And he had not just discovered a new composer of
Dutch extraction.... These are small things, you say.
But are <span class="nw">they?...</span></p>

<p>I remember looking at him and wondering if he really
<em>had</em> written <cite>The Better Land</cite>. It seemed so unlikely.
Faultlessly dressed, immaculately groomed, how <em>could</em>
he have written <cite>The Better Land</cite>—that luteous land that
is so sloppy, so thickly covered with untidy debris?</p>

<p>He would not talk of the musical situation in Manchester,
and I could see that he was very sensitive about his uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p>“If I am wanted, I shall stay,” was all he would give
me.</p>

<p><a name="png.229" id="png.229" href="#png.229"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“And are you going to write about me in the paper?”
asked he, at the end of our interview; “how interesting
that will be!” And he smiled with gentle satire.</p>

<p>“I shall make it as interesting as I can,” I assured
him, “but, you see, you have said so little.”</p>

<p>“Does that matter?” he returned. “I have always
heard that you gentlemen of the Press can at least—shall
we say embroider?”</p>

<p>“But may I?” I asked.</p>

<p>“How can I prevent you? Do tell me how I can, and
I will.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can insist upon seeing the article before it
appears in print.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘insist’ is not a nice word, is it? But if you
would be kind enough to send me the article before your
Editor has <span class="nw">it....”</span></p>

<p>Hans Richter was an autocrat, a tyrant. During the
years he conducted in Manchester, he did much splendid
work, but it may well be questioned if, on the whole,
his influence was beneficial to Manchester citizens. He
was so tremendously German! So tremendously German
indeed, that he refused to recognise that there was any
other than Teutonic music in the world. His intellect
had stopped at Wagner. At middle age his mind had
suddenly become set, and he looked with contempt at all
Italian and French music, refusing also to see any merit
in most of the very fine music that, during the last twenty
years, has been written by British composers.</p>

<p>He irked the younger and more turbulent spirits in
Manchester, and we were constantly attacking him in the
Press. But with no effect. Richter was like that. He
ignored attacks. He was arrogant and spoiled and bad-tempered.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you occasionally give us some French
music at your concerts?” he was asked.</p>

<p><a name="png.230" id="png.230" href="#png.230"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“French music?” he roared; “there <em>is</em> no French
music.”</p>

<p>And, certainly, whenever he tried to play even Berlioz
one could see that he did not regard his work as music.
And he conducted Debussy, so to speak, with his fists.
And as for Dukas...!</p>

<p>Young British musicians used to send him their
compositions to read, but the parcels would come back,
weeks later, unread and unopened. His mind never
inquired. His intellect lay indolent and half-asleep on
a bed of spiritual down. And the thousands of musical
Germans in Manchester treated him so like a god that
in course of time he came to believe he was a god. His
manners were execrable. On one occasion, he bore down
upon me in a corridor at the back of the platform in the
Free Trade Hall. I stood on one side to allow him to pass,
but Richter was very wide and the corridor very narrow.
Breathing heavily, he kept his place in the middle of the
passage.... I felt the impact of a mountain of fat and
heard a snort as he brushed past me.</p>

<p>Everyone was afraid of him. Even famous musicians
trembled in his presence. I remember dining with one
of the most eminent of living pianists at a restaurant
where, at a table close at hand, Richter also was dining.
The previous evening Richter had conducted at a concert
at which the pianist had played, and the great conductor
had praised my friend in enthusiastic terms; moreover,
they had met before on several occasions.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and have a word with the Old Man, if you’ll
excuse me,” said my friend.</p>

<p>I watched him go. Smiling a little, ingratiatingly,
he bowed to Richter, and then bent slightly over the table
at which the famous musician was dining alone. Richter
took not the slightest notice. My friend, embarrassed,
waited a minute or so, and I saw him speaking. But the
diner continued dining. Again my friend spoke, and at
<a name="png.231" id="png.231" href="#png.231"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>length Richter looked up and barked three times. Hastily
the pianist retreated, and when he had rejoined me I
noticed that he was a little pale and breathless.</p>

<p>“The old pig!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why, what happened?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see? First of all, he wouldn’t take the
slightest notice of me or even acknowledge my existence.
I spoke to him in English three times before he would
answer, and then, like the mannerless brute he is, he
replied in German.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? I don’t speak his rotten language.
But it sounded like: ‘Zuzu westeben hab! Zuzu
westeben hab! Zuzu westeben hab!’ I only know
that he was very angry. He was eating slabs of liver
sausage. And he spoke right down in his chest.”</p>

<p>He was, indeed, unapproachable.</p>

<p>Of course, he was a marvellous conductor, a conductor
of genius; but long before he left Manchester his powers
had begun to fail.</p>

<p>For two or three years I made a practice of attending
his rehearsals. Nothing will persuade me that in the
whole world there is a more depressing spot than the
Manchester Free Trade Hall on a winter’s morning. I
used to sit shivering with my overcoat collar buttoned up.
Richter always wore a round black-silk cap, which made
him look like a Greek priest. He would walk ponderously
to the conductor’s desk, seize his baton, rattle it against
the desk, and begin without a moment’s loss of time.
Perhaps it was an innocent work like Weber’s <cite>Der
Freischütz</cite> Overture. This would proceed swimmingly
enough for a minute or so, when suddenly one would
hear a bark and the music would stop. One could not
say that Richter spoke or shouted: he merely made a
disagreeable noise. Then, in English most broken, in
English utterly smashed, he would correct the mistake
<a name="png.232" id="png.232" href="#png.232"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that had been made, and recommence conducting without
loss of a second.</p>

<p>He had no “secret.” Great conductors never do
have “secrets.” Only charlatans “mesmerise” their
orchestras. Simply, he knew his job, he was a great
economiser of time, and he was a stern disciplinarian.</p>

<p>He could lose his temper easily. He hated those of us
who were privileged to attend his rehearsals. He declared,
quite unwarrantably, that we talked and disturbed him.
But he never appeared to be in the least disturbed by
the handful of weary women who, with long brushes,
swept the seats and the floor of the hall, raising whirlpools
of dust fantastically here and there, and banging doors
in beautiful disregard of the Venusberg music and in
protest against the exquisite Allegretto from the Seventh
Symphony.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Sir Thomas Beecham (he was then plain “Mr”) brought
a tin of tobacco to the restaurant, placed it on the table,
and proceeded to fill his pipe. He was not communicative.
He simply sat back in his chair, smoking quietly, and
behaving precisely as though he were alone, though, as
a matter of fact, there were four or five people in his
company. He was not shy: he was simply indifferent
to us. If you spoke to him, he merely said “no” or
“yes” and looked bored. He <em>was</em> bored.</p>

<p>And so he sat for ten minutes; then, with a little sigh,
he rose and departed from among us, without a word,
without a look. He just melted away and never returned.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>I rather dreaded meeting Sir Charles Santley, and when
I rang at his door-bell, I remember devoutly wishing that
in a moment I should hear that he was out, or that he had
changed his mind and no longer desired to see me. I
dreaded meeting him because I realised that, temperamentally,
we were opposed. I had read his reminiscences
<a name="png.233" id="png.233" href="#png.233"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and disliked him intensely for the things he had said of
Rossetti. Instinctively, I drew away from his robust,
tough-fibred mind.</p>

<p>But he was in, and in half-a-minute I was talking to an
old, but still vigorous, gentleman whose one desire appeared
to be to put me at my ease. I do not think I ever met a
man so honest, so blunt. I felt that his mind was direct
and his judgment decisive, but I found him lacking in
subtlety, unable to respond to the mystical in art, and
wholly deficient in true imaginative qualities. He was
Victorian.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t suppose any of us who are living to-day
(and when I say “living” I mean anyone whose mind is
still developing—most people, say, under the age of forty-five)
will be able to understand the point of view of the
Victorian musician. It appears to me monstrous that
anyone should still love Mendelssohn and hate Wagner,
that anyone should sing J. L. Hatton in preference to
Hugo Wolf, that anyone should still delight in Donizetti
and Bellini. Those Victorian days were days when the
singer wished that his own notions of the limitations of the
human voice should control the free development of music.
They loved <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bel canto</i> and nothing else; they averred,
indeed, that there was nothing else to love. They were
admirable musicians from the technical point of view,
and they had honest hearts and by no means feeble
intellects. But they could never be brought to believe
that music was a reflection of life, that there were in the
human heart a thousand shades of feeling that not even
Handel had expressed, that sound is capable of a million
subtleties, that the ear of man is an organ that is, so to
speak, only in its infancy.</p>

<p>It was a little pathetic, I thought, when speaking to
Santley, that this very great singer had been living for
at least thirty years entirely untouched by many of the
finest compositions that had been written in that period.</p>

<p><a name="png.234" id="png.234" href="#png.234"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>And he declared, quite frankly, that “modern” music
had no interest for him. When I mentioned Richard
Strauss, he smiled. At the name of Debussy, he looked
bewildered, and about Max Reger, Scriabin, Granville
Bantock, Sibelius and Delius, he had not a word to say.</p>

<p>But soon we got on to his own subject—singing—and
here again we were at cross-purposes. Singers who to me
seem supreme artists he had either not heard of or had not
heard.</p>

<p>“There is only one British singer to-day who carries
on the old tradition,” said he; “I mean Madame Kirkby
Lunn. She has technique, style, personality. The others,
compared with her, are nowhere.”</p>

<p>Some general talk followed, and I soon discovered,
beyond the possibility of doubt, that, like all great
Victorians who have had their day, he was living in the
past—in that particular past whose artistic spirit is
embodied in the Albert Memorial, in the musical criticism
of J. W. Davidson, in the pianoforte playing of Arabella
Godard, in the poetry of Lord Tennyson, in the pictures
of Lord Leighton, in the prose of Ruskin.</p>

<p>What had Santley to say to me, or I to him? Nothing,
and less than nothing. We were from different worlds,
different planets, for half-a-century divided us. In
years, he was nearer to the Elizabethan age than I ...
and yet how much farther away was he?</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Perhaps Mr Landon Ronald will not be angry with me
if I call him the most accomplished of British musicians.
He would have every right to be angry if I said he was
accomplished and nothing else.... How far back that
word “accomplished” takes us, doesn’t it? Twenty
years, at least. For aught I know to the contrary, it
may still be employed in Putney. I observe that Chambers
defines “accomplishment” as an “ornamental acquirement,”
and, in my boyhood, that was precisely what it
<a name="png.235" id="png.235" href="#png.235"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>meant. Young ladies “acquired” the art of playing
the piano, the art of painting, the art of recitation. Their
skill in any art was not the result of developing a talent
that was already there, but it was the result of a pertinacity
that should have been spent on other things.
But one no longer uses “accomplished” in that precise
sense.</p>

<p>Landon Ronald has more than a streak of genius in his
nature, and his cleverness is so abnormal as to be almost
absurd. His genius and his cleverness are evident even
in a few minutes’ conversation. He radiates cleverness,
and he is so splendidly alive that as soon as he enters
a room you feel that something quick and electric has
been added to your environment.</p>

<p>When I first met him—ten years ago, was it?—his
one ambition was to be recognised throughout Europe as
a great conductor. He was acknowledged as such in
England, of course, and a visit to Rome had fired both
the Italian public and critics with enthusiasm. But
London and Rome are not Europe, whilst in those days
Berlin most distinctly was. He was most charmingly
frank about himself, full of enthusiasm for himself, full
of delight in all life’s adventures.</p>

<p>“Of course, I know my songs aren’t <em>real</em> songs,” he said.
“I can write tunes and I’m a musician, and I’m just
clever enough to be cleverer than most people at that
sort of work. But you must not imagine I take my compositions
seriously. I think they’re rather nice—‘nice’
<em>is</em> the word, isn’t it?—and I enjoy inventing them—and
‘inventing’ is also the word, don’t you think? Besides,
they make money; they help to boil the pot for me
while I go on with my more serious work—that is to say,
conducting.”</p>

<p>Havergal Brian was in the room—we were in that
fulsome and blowzy town, Blackpool—and he remarked,
as so many extraordinarily able composers have from
<a name="png.236" id="png.236" href="#png.236"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time to time remarked, that he found it impossible to
write music that the public really liked.</p>

<p>“Nearly all my stuff,” said he, “is on a big scale for
the orchestra. I am always trying to do something new—something
out of the common rut.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but then,” exclaimed Ronald, quite sincerely,
“you are a composer, and I am not.”</p>

<p>Brian was appeased, and I looked at Ronald with admiration
for his tact. But he went even a little farther.</p>

<p>“I sometimes feel rather a pig,” he continued, “making
money by my trifles when so many men with much greater
gifts can only rarely get their work performed and still
more rarely get it published. You told us just now,” said
he, turning to Brian, “that you would like to make
money by your compositions. Who wouldn’t? Well,
it would be foolish of me to advise you to try to write
more simply, with less originality, and on a smaller scale.
It would be foolish, because you simply couldn’t do it.
No; you must work out your own salvation: it is only a
matter of waiting: success will come.”</p>

<p>A month or two later, we met at Southport, I in the
meantime having written an article on Ronald for a
musical magazine. With this article he professed himself
charmed. He was as jolly about it as a schoolboy,
and expressed surprise that I could honestly say such
nice things about him.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> good to be praised,” said he, laughing; “I
could live on praise for ever.” And then, lighting a
cigarette, he added: “Perhaps the reason why I like
it so much is that I feel I really deserve it.”</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh.</p>

<p>“But I do feel that!” he protested; “if I didn’t,
I should hate you or anyone else to say such frightfully
kind things about me and my work.”</p>

<p>A month or two later he wrote me a long letter full of
enthusiasm for some work of mine he had seen
<a name="png.237" id="png.237" href="#png.237"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>somewhere, and when I saw him the following week in London
I protested against his undiluted praise.</p>

<p>“I believe you think I am a bit of a humbug,” said he.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I do,” I replied. (For, really, I think
almost all subtle and clever artists are bits of humbugs.)</p>

<p>“Very good, then!” exclaimed he, ridiculously hurt.</p>

<p>“What I mean is, that if you like anyone, your judgment
is immediately prejudiced in their favour.”</p>

<p>“So you think I like you?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re quite right. But, really and truly,
you mustn’t call me, or even think me, the slightest bit
of a humbug. You can call me impulsive, superficial,
or anything horrid of that kind ... but insincere!
Why, sincerity is the only real virtue I’ve got.”</p>

<p>And I believe he believed himself. But who is sincere?—at
least, who is sincere except at the moment? Are not
all of us who are artists swayed hither and thither, from
hour to hour, by the emotion of the moment? Do we
not say one thing now, and an hour later mean exactly
the opposite? Are we not driven by our enthusiasms
to false positions, and do not glib, untrue words spring
to our lips because the moment’s mood forces them
there?</p>

<p>I have not met Landon Ronald for four years, but the
other day I heard him conduct, and I recognised in his
interpretations the supreme qualities I have so often
observed before. He himself is like his work—polished,
highly strung, emotional, fluid, intense. His mind works
with lightning-like quickness; he knows what you are
going to say just a second before you have said it. And
over his personality hangs the glamour that we call genius.</p>

<p>Many well-known singers have I met, but very few of
them inspire me to burst into song. They are a dull,
vain crew. Among the few most notable exceptions is
<a name="png.238" id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Frederic Austin, a man with a temperament so refined,
with a nature so retiring, that it is a constant source of
wonder to me that he should be where he now is—in
the front rank of vocalists.</p>

<p>Years ago Ernest Newman said to me:</p>

<p>“Frederic Austin has become a fine singer through
sheer brain-work. He always had temperament, but his
voice was never in the least remarkable until by ingenious
training, by constant thought, and by the most arduous
labour he developed it until it became an organ of sufficient
strength and richness to enable him to interpret anything
that appeals to him.”</p>

<p>He is, I think, the only eminent singer in this country
who is a distinguished composer. But perhaps the most
remarkable thing about him is that you might very easily
pass days in his company without guessing that he is a
famous singer, for his personality suggests qualities that
famous singers seldom possess. He is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</i>, austere,
and devoted to his art.</p>

 />TWO CHELSEA “RAGS,” 1914 AND 1918</h2>


<h3>1914</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">It</span> used to begin as a rumour, a faint stirring and
excitement in King’s Road, Chelsea. The artist
on the top floor of Joubert Studios—an artist who
had a private income and a gently nursed hypochondria—received
a parcel from home: a couple of cooked chickens,
perhaps, a tongue, cakes, crystallised fruits, three bottles
of wine and so on. The lady who occupied the studio
below, and the musical critic who lived in the third studio
from the top, were duly apprised of the fact, and Norman
and Eddie Morrow were called in from near by for a
consultation.</p>

<p>“Clearly,” the lady remarked, “a rag is indicated. A
rag must always have a beginning, and this undoubtedly
is a most excellent beginning. Ring up Susie, somebody,
and fetch Hearn over and Ivan and let the Cumberlands
know; and, oh! Hughes, dear little Herbert, lend me
your pots and pans and things. And, Warlow, just run
round everywhere and tell all the people you meet.
Don’t forget John, and I think that Deane would like
that girl with fuzzy hair. We’ll begin at seven. No,
we won’t: we’ll begin now.”</p>

<p>And Warlow, nursing his hypochondria and being very
biddable, sighed and moved away, saying beseechingly
as he went:</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> leave me a wing, won’t you? I’ve had no
breakfast yet.”</p>

<p><a name="png.240" id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But neither had the rest, and by the time Warlow,
suffering in a resigned and patient kind of way from
paleness and breathlessness, returned, one of the chickens
had vanished, and the long table with its litter of paper,
cardboard, pencils and paint, was now littered also with
plates and knives and forks and breadcrumbs. The rag
had begun.</p>

<p>The month was May, a true May with a warm wind,
a warmer sun, and fluttering green leaves. The little
party—the nucleus of the much larger party that was to
meet there in the evening—drifted downstairs to Hughes’s
studio where there was a grand piano and a portable
harmonium which appeared to belong to no one in particular.
Hughes, looking a little ruefully at the MS.
upon which he was engaged, put it away on a shelf,
opened his wide windows and began to play. Harry
Lowe, with his magnificent but untrained voice, appeared
dramatically in the doorway and sang:</p>

<table summary="Song sung by Harry Lowe" id="song">
<tr><td class="ctr" id="largo">
<div><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Largo<br
  />grandioso</i></div></td><td class="largo"><div class="stanza">
<div>For he’s a Scotsman, a bonny Scotsman,</div>
<div class="i3"><span class="ns">      </span>His feyther and his mither,</div>
<div class="i3"><span class="ns">      </span>His sister and his <span class="nw">brither—</span></div></div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ctr">(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Forte</i>)</td><td class="l2"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i3"><span class="ns">      </span>Is all Sco-otch too.</div></div></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This went to a great tune devised, invented, composed
and arranged by Hughes and Lowe. The great air,
heard with its cunning chatter of an accompaniment from
the piano, put everyone in the right mood, and Norman
Morrow, whose head was always full of ideas, began to
prepare “stunts” for the evening, whilst Warlow, having
nothing better to do, attired himself as an Italian Count,
sat at the open window, and smiled sadly at all the girls
whose attention he could attract in the street below.</p>

<p>Norman’s idea was a revue—a revue of Any Old
Thing: Mona Lisa, the sale of beautiful slaves, the
Salome Dance by six-foot-two Harry Lowe, the Innocent
<a name="png.241" id="png.241" href="#png.241"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Wench who took the Wrong Turning, etc., etc. He
wanted to prepare the groundwork for the evening’s
performance; the details could be filled in on the spur
of the moment. But, in the afternoon rehearsal, several
scenes, exciting the actors, were studied carefully to the
most minute particular. Kitty, in the meantime, was
upstairs preparing food, her dainty hands fluttering over
salads and sandwiches. At six, jolly, lovable little
Susie rushed from her work, revitalised everybody, and
sang in her funny little voice, holding a cigarette in one
hand and a saucepan in the other.</p>

<p>But before the Rag Proper began, many charming
idiocies were enacted. Warlow and Eddie Morrow walked
to Sloane Square (it is conceivable that they called at the
Six Bells on the way) for the sole purpose of riding back
again in a taxi-cab, Warlow in a great Russian overcoat
smothered in fur, Eddie a little unkempt and looking as
though he had just stepped out of one of J. M. Synge’s
plays. Harry Lowe telephoned a number of telegrams
to a far-off post office where it was supposed there was
a lady who owned his heart and sold postage stamps.
Norman Morrow sat in a corner daubing pieces of brown
paper with yellow paint and chuckling inconsequently
to himself. All three studios, one above the other,
appeared to be in glorious disorder, but, as a matter of
fact, nearly every brain was busy with preparations, and
by seven o’clock everything was ready for the great
<span class="nw">rag....</span></p>

<p>I cannot re-create the scene for you. I do not know
quite how it is, but the gaiety, the light-heartedness of
that most jolly evening ooze from my heart as I write.
I am not sufficient of an artist to sweep from my heart
all the sad, irrecoverable things that my heart remembers.
Especially, I cannot forget Ivan Heald, who now lies dead.
(A year later he was to say to me, in that same studio:
“This is a real good-bye, Gerald. It is not possible that
<a name="png.242" id="png.242" href="#png.242"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>both of us will survive this.”... And, of course, it is he
who has gone. One feels mean in surviving, in enjoying
the savour of life, when one’s best friends have
<span class="nw">departed.) ...</span></p>

<p>The artistic Irishman is a perfect actor, an inimitable
mimic, and the two Morrows surpassed everyone. If
ever you have seen Eddie Morrow, it will appear to you
inconceivable that he could ever make a good Mona Lisa.
Yet his Mona Lisa was perfect. He smiled so mysteriously,
so faintly, so imaginatively, that Walter Pater, had he
seen him, would have rewritten that swooning chapter
which contains so much of art’s opiate.... I remember
Edith Heald who, unexpectedly to me, revealed consummate
art as a nigger-boy, her eyes rolling in rapt
wonderment. I remember Hearn’s eyeglasses, and the
smiling eyes behind them, and the little scurry of words
that occasionally came from his lips when something
magical touched his spirit. And I can hear Herbert
Hughes’ contented voice saying: “Well, this is rather
splendid, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>Hughes was awfully good to me on these occasions,
for he would allow me to improvise the music for the
dumb charades, though as an extempore player—and,
indeed, as a player of any kind—he is worlds above me.
And I used to love to invent Eastern Dances à la Bantock
to fit the gyrations of Harry Lowe, or Debussy chords
for anything shadowy and sentimental, or chromatic
melodies—prolonged and melting things in the “O Star
of Eve” manner—for luscious love scenes, or fat, bulgy
discords when some real tomfoolery was afoot.</p>

<p>You must imagine everybody gay and, occasionally,
just a little riotous; in remembrance, it seems to me very
beautiful because so happy and childlike. And you must
imagine everybody very friendly, even to complete
strangers. There was a carnival atmosphere. Clever
people were there with their brains burning bright. There
<a name="png.243" id="png.243" href="#png.243"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were wit, music, wine, pretty women, courtesy, infinite
good-will.</p>

<p>Perhaps, towards midnight, we would seek change in
quietness, and, lying on rugs spread on the waxed floor,
would listen to Norman singing, unaccompanied, an Irish
Rebel song, and something a little hard would come into
Irish Susie’s eyes for a moment or two, and I remember
with regret how, some months after war had broken out,
I said after Norman had been singing that it was no longer
pleasant to me to hear Rebel songs. Regret? Yes;
for when I said that I was a prig and was imagining
myself as something of a soldier-hero. If only Norman
were alive now to sing whatsoever songs he liked!</p>

<p>Well, the evening lapsed into night and the night into
morn, and again we became boisterous and new ideas
were put into shape and little tragedies were given in the
burlesque manner. The resourcefulness of the mimes!
The devilishly clever satire! The good spirits that never
<span class="nw">failed!...</span></p>

<p>It is no use. I cannot describe for you one of those
great nights, for the mood will not come. And one of the
reasons why I cannot recapture the spirit of a Chelsea
Rag as it was in the old days, is because whilst I am writing
I have in my mind a picture of a very different kind.</p>

<h3>1918</h3>

<p>Early in 1918 I was in London for a brief period after
an absence from England of more than two years spent
in France, Egypt, Greece and Serbia. My health was
broken, my spirits were low. The Chelsea people were
dispersed; only Hearn, with his lame foot, was left of the
men, but several of the women were to be found. Herbert
Hughes, by some miracle, was on leave, and he turned up
<a name="png.244" id="png.244" href="#png.244"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>244<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>unexpectedly one night at my flat. We talked quietly,
laughed a little, had some music, and fell into silence.</p>

<p>“Those great days!” said I, apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>“Yes. Nothing like them will come again. But all
of us who remain alive and are still in England must meet.
What about next Sunday? We’ll meet at Madame’s.”</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. Next Sunday there were seven
of us to make merry, whereas in former days there were
forty or fifty. But we seven were together once more:
we who, as it were, had been saved—saved perhaps only
temporarily.</p>

<p>It is a long studio in which we sit, but screens enclose
a piano, the fireplace, a few rugs and chairs, and a table.
Madame is tall and quiet and distinguished; her light
soprano voice conveys an impression of wistfulness, and
her personality, full of charm and a sadness that does not
conceal her courage, diffuses itself throughout the room.
We have met together for a rag, but no one evinces the
least desire to indulge in any violent jollity.</p>

<p>Hughes goes to the piano, for a piano always draws
him as a magnet draws steel, and sometimes, half-consciously,
he feels the pull of one before he has seen it.
He goes to the piano and, perking his nose at an angle of
about forty degrees with the horizontal, plays French songs
very quietly, whilst we sit gazing into the heart of the fire,
each with his own thoughts, and probably each with the
same thoughts—thoughts of Harry Lowe in Greece, of
Gordon Warlow in Mesopotamia, of those who lie dead,
though but two years before they were more alive than
we ourselves, of those who have gone to France and
never <span class="nw">returned....</span></p>

<p>And Madame, moving with our thoughts, gently rises
and joins Hughes and begins, her hands clasped on her
breast, to sing with most alluring grace things by Hahn,
Debussy and Duparc. The music lulls us into a very
luxury of sadness, into a mood in which grief loses its edge
<a name="png.245" id="png.245" href="#png.245"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and sorrow its poignancy. To me, who have heard no
music for two years, her singing is mercilessly beautiful,
so beautiful, indeed, that my breathing becomes uneven
and my eyes wet. And once again I feel that spinal
shiver which, as a little boy, I used to experience when I
heard an anthem by Gounod or just caught the sound of
a military band as it marched down another road....
I never used to run from the house to see the band, for
even in those early days I had an intuitive knowledge
that beauty is mystery, and that to probe mysteries is to
mar, if not altogether to kill, beauty.... And to-night,
when Madame comes to the end of each song, I do not
speak, I scarcely breathe, so fearful am I that the spell
may be broken. But something of the spell lasts even
when she ceases singing altogether and, looking at my
wife, I know that she feels it too—that, indeed, all in our
little company are more quietly happy, more reconciled
to all the brutality and ugliness over the sea, than we have
been for a long age.</p>

<p>We talk in quiet tones about the past, the present and
the future, each contributing something to the common
stock of conversation. Madame brings us tea and cakes,
and we listen to the dim rumour of traffic in King’s
Road. And then, not very late, moved by a common
impulse, we rise to leave, and talking softly as we go,
make our way outside where, as we did in that spot three
years ago, we say farewell, wondering as we do so what
Fate has in store for each of us and whether for one or
more of us this is the end of our life in Chelsea—a life
in which we have worked hard and played hard, enjoying
both work and play, and in which we have been carelessly
unmindful of the danger lying in wait for our country.</p>

 />SOME MORE MUSICIANS</h2>

<p class="chapcontents"><small>Professor Granville Bantock—Frederick Delius—Joseph Holbrooke—Dr Walford Davies—Dr Vaughan Williams—Dr W. G.
M‘Naught—Julius Harrison—Rutland Boughton—John
Coates—Cyril Scott</small></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcapA">At</span> the present moment there are only two names
that are of vital importance in British creative
music—Sir Edward Elgar and Granville Bantock.
No two men could be in more violent contrast: Elgar,
conservative, soured with the aristocratic point of view,
super-refined, deeply religious; Bantock, democratic,
Rabelaisian, free-thinking, gorgeously human.</p>

<p>Of the two, Bantock is the more original, the deeper
thinker, the more broadly sympathetic.</p>

<p>It must be about ten years ago that, staying a week-end
with Ernest Newman, I was taken by my host one
evening to Bantock’s house in Moseley. I remember
Bantock’s bulky form rising from the table at which he
was scoring the first part of his setting of <cite>Omar Khayyám</cite>,
and I recollect that, as soon as we had shaken hands, he
took from his pocket an enormous cigar-case of many
compartments that shut in upon themselves concertina-fashion.
From another pocket he produced a huge
match-box containing matches almost as large as the chips
of wood commonly used for lighting fires. Having
carefully selected a cigar for me, he struck a match that,
spluttering like a firework, calmed down into a huge blaze.
He gazed upon me very solemnly and rather critically
all the time I was lighting up, but his face relaxed into a
<a name="png.247" id="png.247" href="#png.247"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>smile when, having plunged my cigar into the middle of
the flame, I left it there for many seconds and did not
withdraw it until the cigar itself had momentarily flamed
and until it glowed like a miniature furnace.</p>

<p>I was destined to smoke very many of Bantock’s
cigars, and I hope that when the war is over I shall smoke
many more; but I never lit a cigar he handed me without
noticing that he invariably observed me very closely and
a trifle anxiously, as though afraid I should fail in some
detail of the holy rite. I do not think I ever did fail, for
he never met me without offering me a cheroot, which he
certainly would never have done if I had omitted any
necessary observance of the lighting ceremonial.</p>

<p>That first evening we talked a good deal—at least,
Newman and a few other friends did; but Bantock, never
a very loquacious man, committed himself to nothing
save a few generalities. By no means a cautious man in
his mode of life, he is nevertheless cautious in his choice
of friends, and no man can freeze more quickly than he
when uncongenial company is thrust upon him. There
were several strangers in our little circle, and Bantock
was content for the most part to sit back in his easy-chair
and listen.</p>

<p>The following night we met again at the Midland
Institute, Birmingham, where Ernest Newman was giving
one of his witty and brilliant lectures. Bantock insisted
upon my sitting on the platform, though for what reason
I do not know, unless it was to satisfy his impish instinct
for putting shy and self-conscious people into prominent
positions. At that time he and Newman were the closest
of friends, and as Newman and I were on very friendly
terms, Bantock was disposed to regard me very favourably;
at all events, before we parted that evening, he showed
me clearly enough that he did not actually dislike me,
for he invited me to visit him for a week-end whenever
I saw my way clear to do so. From that time onward
<a name="png.248" id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>248<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I met him frequently in his own house, in Manchester,
London, Wrexham, Gloucester, Liverpool, Birmingham
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Soon it became a regular practice of mine to run over
from Manchester to Liverpool every alternate Saturday
to attend the afternoon rehearsal and the evening concert
of the Philharmonic Society, the orchestra of which
Bantock conducted. These were very pleasant meetings,
for a party of us used to stay at the London and North
Western Hotel and we would sit until the small hours
of Sunday morning talking music, returning to our respective
homes on Sunday afternoon. At these times
Bantock was at his best, and Bantock’s best makes the
finest company in the world. In his presence one always
feels warm and deeply comfortable, and yet very much
alive; he made a glow; he reconciled one to oneself.
I would not call him a brilliant, or even a good, talker,
but I can with truth call him a very wise one; and in
argument he is unassailable.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Though I used frequently to go to Liverpool to hear
Bantock conduct, I did not do so because I regarded him
as a great artist with the baton. Of his ability in this
direction, there is no doubt; but that he is an interpretative
genius no qualified critic would assert. No: it was
the personality of the man himself, and the new, modern
works he used to include in his programmes that drew
me to Liverpool. Bantock, at that period, was almost
passionately modern. I remember with amusement how
pettish he used sometimes to pretend to be when, perhaps
in deference to public opinion (but perhaps he was overruled
by a Committee?), he felt compelled to include a
Beethoven symphony in one of his concerts.</p>

<p>On one occasion I met him at Lime Street Station,
Liverpool, when he emerged from the train carrying a
bundle of loose scores under his arm.</p>

<p><a name="png.249" id="png.249" href="#png.249"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>249<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Let me carry your books for you,” said I.</p>

<p>He selected the least bulky and lightest of the scores
he was carrying, and handed it to me.</p>

<p>“You are always a good chap, Cumberland,” he remarked.
“Do take this; it’s the heaviest of the lot:
Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. So very heavy.” He
sighed. “And so dry that merely to carry it makes me
thirsty. How many times have you heard it?”</p>

<p>But he was poking a cigar into my mouth, and I could
not answer until it was well alight.</p>

<p>“At least fifty or sixty. Oh, more than that! Eight
times, say, every year for the last fifteen years—one
hundred and twenty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, always a good chap, and so very patient,” he
murmured to himself. “Do you know, Cumberland, I
had to work—yes, to <em>work</em>—at that Symphony in the train.
And I define work as doing something that gives you no
pleasure. Talking about work, I must post these before
I forget.”</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a number of post cards all
addressed to Ernest Newman. These post cards appeared
to amuse him immensely, and he handed them to me with
a smile. There were about a dozen of them, and each
bore an anagram of the word “work”—<span class="smc">KROW</span>, <span class="smc">WROK</span>,
<span class="smc">ROWK</span>, <span class="smc">RWKO</span>, etc.</p>

<p>“He’ll receive these by the first post in the morning,”
Bantock explained, “and if they don’t succeed in making
him jump out of bed and finish his analysis of my <cite>Omar
Khayyám</cite> for Breitkopf and Härtel, nothing will.”</p>

<p>Point was added to the jest by the fact that Newman
has always been a particularly hard, and generally very
heavily pressed worker.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>In his early manhood Bantock travelled a good deal in
the East, not so much by choice, but because circumstances
drove him thither. Yet I often feel that the
<a name="png.250" id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>East is his natural home. Whether or not he has any close
acquaintance with Eastern languages, I do not know,
but he certainly likes his friends to think he has, and
many of the letters he has sent me contain quotations
and odd words written in what I take to be Persian and
Chinese characters. I should not, however, be in the
least surprised to learn that these are “faked,” for Bantock
loves nothing so much as gently pulling the legs of his
friends.</p>

<p>He has not, however, the foresight of Eastern people.
His enthusiasms drive him into extremes and into monetary
extravagances. When he lived at Broadmeadow,
with its extensive wooded grounds, outside Birmingham,
he had a mania for bulbs, and I remember his showing
me a stable the floor of which was covered with crocus,
daffodil, jonquil and narcissus bulbs.</p>

<p>“But,” protested I, “these ought to have been planted
months ago.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” he said sadly. “But the gardener
is so busy. Still, there they are.”</p>

<p>His philosophic outlook has been largely directed by
Eastern philosophy. He admires cunning and takes a
beautiful and childlike delight in believing that he possesses
that quality in abundance. But in reality, he cannot
deceive. Even his card tricks are amateurish, and his
chess-playing is only just good.</p>

<p>Apropos of his chess-playing, I remember that some
years ago a chess enthusiast—a bore of the vilest description—used
to visit him regularly and stay to a very late
hour for the purpose of playing a game. These visits
soon became intolerable, and, one evening, as Bantock,
irritated and petulant, sat opposite his opponent, he
resolved to put an end to the nuisance.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a moment,” said he; “I have left my
cigar-box upstairs, and I really can’t do without a
smoke.”</p>

<p><a name="png.251" id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He left the room, and went straight to bed and to sleep.
Next time he met his visitor, they merely bowed.</p>

<p>Bantock used to relate this story with the greatest
glee, and in the course of time the yarn grew to colossal
dimensions. It became epical. One was told how his
visitor was heard calling: “Bantock! Bantock! I’ve
taken your Queen,” how strange noises proceeded from
dark rooms, and how, next morning, his visitor, having
sat up all night, was found wide awake trying the effect
of certain combinations of moves on the board. When a
thing is said three times, it is, of course, true, but Bantock
never told exactly the same story three times. He
believes, I think, that consistency is the refuge and the
consolation of the dull-witted.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Frederick Delius, a Yorkshireman, has chosen to live
most of his artistic life abroad, and for this reason is
not familiarly known to his countrymen, though he is a
great personage in European music. A pale man, ascetic,
monkish; a man with a waspish wit; a man who allows
his wit to run away with him so far that he is tempted to
express opinions he does not really hold.</p>

<p>I met him for a short hour in Liverpool, where, over
food and drink snatched between a rehearsal and a
concert, he showed a keen intellect and a fine strain of
malice. Like most men of genius, he is curiously self-centred,
and I gathered from his remarks that he is not
particularly interested in any music except his own. He
is (or was) greatly esteemed in Germany, and if in his
own country he has not a large following, he alone is to
blame.</p>

<p>He is a man who pursues a path of his own, indifferent
to criticism, and perhaps indifferent to indifference.
Decidedly a man of most distinguished intellect and a
quick, eager but not responsive personality, but not a
musician who marks an epoch as does Richard Strauss,
<a name="png.252" id="png.252" href="#png.252"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and not a man who has formed a school, as Debussy has
done.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Joseph Holbrooke, for sheer cleverness, for capacity
for hard work, and for intellectual energy, has no equal
among our composers. It was Newman who first spoke
to me about him, and it was Newman who made me curious
to meet this extraordinary genius.</p>

<p>Holbrooke’s weakness—but I do not consider it a
weakness—is his pugnacity. He has fought the critics
times without number and, in many cases, with excellent
results for British music, though Holbrooke must know
much better than I do that in fighting for his colleagues
he has incidentally injured himself. A chastised critic
is the last person in the world likely to write a fair and
unbiassed article on a new work produced by the hand
that chastised him. But not only the critics have felt
the lash of Holbrooke’s scorn: conductors, musical
institutions, some very prosperous so-called composers,
committees, publishers and, indeed, almost every kind
of man who has power in the musical world, have felt his
sting.</p>

<p>But if he is clever and witty in his writing, he is much
cleverer and wittier in his talk. I do not suppose I
shall ever forget one Sunday I spent with him, for by
midday he had reduced my mind to chaos and my body
to limpness by his consuming energy. When he was not
playing, he was talking, and he did both as though the
day were the last he was going to spend on earth, so eager
and convulsive was his speech, so vehement his playing.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most remarkable quality is his power
of concentration. I remember his telling me that when
he was yachting with Lord Howard de Walden in the
Mediterranean, he was engaged on the composition of
<cite>Dylan</cite>, an opera containing some of the most gorgeous
and weirdly uncanny music that has been written in our
<a name="png.253" id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>generation. At this opera he worked, not in hours of
inspiration (for, like Arnold Bennett, he does not believe
in inspiration), but when he had nothing more exciting
or more necessary to do. For example, he would begin
work in the morning, cheerfully and without regret lay
down his pen at lunch-time, return to his music immediately
lunch was finished, and unhesitatingly recommence
writing at the point at which he had left off. Interruptions
that arouse the anger of the ordinary creative artist
do not disturb him in the least. He can work just as
composedly and as fluently when a heated argument is
being conducted in the room as he can in a room that
is absolutely quiet. Music, indeed, flows from him, and if
moods come to him which render his brain numb and his
soul barren, I doubt if they last more than a day or two.</p>

<p>Of the truly vast quantity of music he has written, I,
to my regret, know only a portion, and that belongs
chiefly to his very early period, when he was under the
influence of Edgar Allan Poe. Poe is his spiritual affinity,
and Holbrooke’s setting of <cite>Annabel Lee</cite>—a work which I
can play backwards from memory—is more beautiful
and haunting than the beautiful and haunting poem itself.</p>

<p>I have called Holbrooke pugnacious and, some years
ago, much to his amusement and, I think, gratification,
I called him the stormy petrel of music. But what makes
him stormy? What are the defects in our musical life
that he so persistently attacks? First of all, he hates
incompetence, especially official incompetence, and the
incompetence that makes vast sums of money. He hates
commercialism in art, and by that phrase I mean the
various enterprises that exploit art for the sole purpose
of making money. He hates publishers who issue trash;
he hates critics who write rubbish. He hates the obscurity
in which so many of his gifted colleagues live, and he hates
the love of the British public for foreign music inferior
to that which is being written at home. And I believe
<a name="png.254" id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he hates the system that presents editors of newspapers
with free concert tickets for the use of their critics.</p>

<p>But, in dwelling at such length on Holbrooke’s combativeness,
I feel I am giving a rather one-sided view
of his true character. For he is not all hate. Indeed,
it is true to state that no composer has written more in
appreciation of men who may be considered his rivals.
He is anxious and quick to study the work of men of the
younger generation, and whenever any of that work
appeals to him he either performs it in public or writes
to the papers about it.</p>

<p>I have heard him called perverse, unreliable, injudicious,
and many other disagreeable things. He may be. But
Holbrooke is not an angel. He is simply a composer
of genius working under conditions that tend to thwart
and paralyse genius.</p>

<p>Dr Walford Davies!... Well, what can I say about
Dr Walford Davies except that he represents all the
things in which I have no deep faith?—asceticism, fine-fingeredism,
religiosity, “mutual improvement,” narrowness
of intellect, physical coldness. I love some of his
songs—simple things of exquisite tenderness, but it would
be futile to regard him as anything more than a cultured
gentleman with considerable musical gifts.</p>

<p>On two or three occasions I have been thrown into his
company, but I have never been able to decide whether
he is ignorant of my existence or whether he dislikes me
so intensely that he cannot bring himself to recognise
my existence.</p>

<p>He is terribly in earnest—in earnest about Brahms
and perhaps about Frau Schumann also. He wrinkles
his forehead about Brahms and poises a white hand in
the air.... Please do not imagine that I do not love
Brahms: I adore him. But Brahms was not God.
He was not even a god. Whereas Wagner.... It was
<a name="png.255" id="png.255" href="#png.255"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in 1911, I think, that I heard Dr Walford Davies preaching
about Brahms. Now, if you preach about Brahms, you
are eternally lost, for you exclude both Wagner and
Hugo Wolf.</p>

<p>How exasperating it must be to possess a temperament
that can accept only part of what is admirable! It
seems to me that Walford Davies distrusts his intellect:
in estimating the worth of music, he seems to say, intellectual
standards, artistic standards, are of no value.
To him the only sure test is temperamental affinity. And
he wishes all temperaments to conform to his own
limitations.</p>

<p>I have seen Dr Davies near Temple Gardens with choir-boys
hanging on his arm, with choir-boys prancing before
him and following faithfully behind him. A shepherd
with his sheep! I am sure he exerts upon them what is
known as a “good influence.” But in matters of art how
bad that good influence may be! Did ever a worshipper
of Wagner walk the rooms of the Y.M.C.A.?</p>

<p>I have a very bad memory for the names of public-houses
and hotels (though I love these places dearly), and
I regret that I am unable to recall the name of that very
attractive hotel in Birmingham where, early one evening,
Dr Vaughan Williams, travel-stained and brown with the
sun, walked into the lounge and began a conversation
with me. He had walked an incredible distance, and
though, physically, he was very tired, his mind was most
alert, and we fell to talking about music. He told me
that he had studied with Ravel, and when he told me
this I reviewed in my mind in rapid succession all Vaughan
Williams’ compositions I could remember, trying to detect
in any of them traces of Ravel’s influence. But I was
unsuccessful. To me he, with his essential British downrightness,
his love of space, his freedom from all mannerisms
and tricks of style, seemed Ravel’s very antithesis.</p>

<p><a name="png.256" id="png.256" href="#png.256"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Like myself, he had come to Birmingham to listen to
music, and the following evening, after we had heard a
long choral work of Bantock’s, we had what might have
developed into a very hot argument. With him was
Dr Cyril Rootham, a very charming and cultivated
musician, and both these composers were amazed and
amused when, having asked my opinion of Bantock’s
work, I became dithyrambic in its praise.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were modern?” asked Williams.</p>

<p>“I am anything you please,” said I; “when I hear
Richard Strauss I am modern, and when I listen to Bach
I am prehistoric. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Moody and Sankey,” murmured Rootham.</p>

<p>Williams laughed.</p>

<p>“Good! damned good!” he exclaimed, turning to his
companion. “You’ve got it. Hasn’t he, Cumberland?”<!-- TN: original has closing single quote --></p>

<p>“Got what?”</p>

<p>“It. Him. Bantock, I mean. Now, don’t you think—concede
us this one little point—don’t you think that
this thirty-two-part choral work of Bantock’s is just
Moody and Sankey over again? Glorified, of course:
gilt-edged, tooled, diamond-studded, bound in lizard-skin,
if you like: but still Moody and still Sankey.”</p>

<p>I clutched the sleeve of a passing waiter and ordered
a double whisky.</p>

<p>“One can only drink,” said I. “And when people
disagree so fundamentally as we do, whisky is the only
tipple that makes one forget.”</p>

<p>But, either late that night or late the following night, we
found music in which we could both take keen pleasure.
Herbert Hughes played us some of his songs, and I
remember Samuel Langford, breathing rather heavily
behind me, becoming more and more enthusiastic as the
night wore on. Williams, to whom also the songs were
new, took a vivid interest in them.</p>

<p>“I like your Herbert Hughes,” said Langford.</p>

<p><a name="png.257" id="png.257" href="#png.257"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>257<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“<em>My</em> Herbert Hughes?”</p>

<p>“Well, you do rather monopolise him. And I don’t
wonder. He’s what one calls the ... <span class="nw">the ...”</span></p>

<p>“The goods?”</p>

<p>Langford laughed in his beard and his eyes disappeared.</p>

<p>The last glimpse I had of Vaughan Williams was two
or three years later, outside Hughes’ studio in Chelsea.
We stood for a minute in the darkened street.</p>

<p>“Going to see Hughes?” I asked.</p>

<p>But he was busy with preparations for enlisting, and
a few weeks later he, Hughes and myself and nearly all
our Chelsea circle were swept into the army.</p>

<p>In June or July, 1917, I missed Vaughan Williams at
Summerhill, near Salonica, by a day. But perhaps when
the war is finished...?</p>

<p>Dr W. G. McNaught, though a musician of the older
school, is one of the youngest, most up-to-date and most
powerful of our musical scholars. By one means or
another, the influence of his personality is felt in every
town and village in the British Isles. He is the editor of
the best of our musical papers, a faultless and ubiquitous
adjudicator at our great musical festivals, a witty and
most reliable writer, a profound scholar, and a man of
such natural geniality and spontaneity that he is liked by
everyone. As a rule, I detest men who are liked on all
hands, but I could never detest Dr McNaught even if he
were to detest me and tell me so.</p>

<p>I do not remember when I first met him, and I do not
think I have any special anecdotes to relate about him.
But, in thinking of him now, and reviewing our friendly
acquaintanceship of eight or ten years, I recall that I
have never been able to persuade him to take me seriously.
He has printed all the articles I have sent him, but he has
always laughed indulgently at both them and me. I
cannot help wondering why. Perhaps his exasperatingly
<a name="png.258" id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>258<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>clever son has betrayed the secrets I have entrusted to him:
the facts that my piano-playing is amateurish, my scholarship
nil, and my ear fatally defective. And I think I
once showed McNaught, jun., some of my compositions.
One should never show (but of course I mean “show off”)
one’s compositions when one cannot compose.</p>

<p>Unless you are something of a musician yourself, you
will probably never have heard the name of Julius Harrison,
for though he has fame of a kind, and of the best kind,
he is scarcely known to the man in the street. Just as
Rossetti is primarily a poet for poets, so is Julius Harrison
a musician for musicians. Only one word describes him:
distinguished. Very distinguished he is, with the refinement
and sensitiveness of a poet, the intuition of a novelist,
and the waywardness of all men who allow themselves to
be governed by impulse.</p>

<p>When I first met him he was little more than a brilliant
boy full of rich promise. He lived at Stourport, where I
used to go occasionally and pass a few days with him
on the river. I knew of nothing against him save that
he was an organist, and I feared that he might be tempted
to remain an organist and build up a teaching “practice,”
just as a doctor builds up a practice. But I was mistaken.
He ventured on London, suffered obscurity for a year or
two, worked like a fiery little devil, and at length threw
up the hack-work that kept him alive. Then he emerged,
very engaging and very likeable, into the real musical
world of London. Sir Thomas Beecham gave him <cite>Tristan
und Isolde</cite> and other operas to conduct, the London
Philharmonic Society invited him to interpret to it one
of his own works, and concerts devoted entirely to his
compositions were given in several provincial towns. In
five years he will be recognised as the greatest conductor
England has yet given us; in ten years he will have a
European reputation as a composer.</p>

<p><a name="png.259" id="png.259" href="#png.259"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>What is he like? He is mercurial, passionate, loyal,
snobbish, charming, outspoken, very open to his
friends.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> snobbish, Gerald; we have agreed about that,
so you won’t quarrel with me, will you?” he has asked
several times.</p>

<p>“Apropos?” I have answered.</p>

<p>“Well, I really can’t stick your pal, So-and-so. An
out-and-out bounder.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Julius. But he bounds so beautifully. Besides,
he has real talent.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll never ask me to meet him, will you?”</p>

<p>“When I’m rich, Julius, I shall have two flats—one
where you and your friends can come, and another where
my bounderish friends may foregather. But I’m afraid
I shall be oftener at the flat you visit than at the other.
You <em>are</em> a beast—what makes you so snobbish? And
why do you continue to like me, who am not ‘quite’ a
gentleman in your eyes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are, Gerald. Well, perhaps you’re not.
Only in your case it doesn’t seem to matter. You are
so full of affectations—jolly little affectations, I admit,
but <span class="nw">still....”</span></p>

<p>I don’t think anything will break our friendship, for
Julius is good and generous enough to allow me to say
the rudest things in the world to him. He only laughs.
For my part, I can forgive him anything, for he admires
my poems. And I suppose he will always forgive me much
for I admire without stint his genius as a conductor and
his genius as a composer. I think that at heart he will
always remain a boy, a boy full of passionate dignity,
of untarnished ideals, of frequent impulses.</p>

<p>Of all unhappy artists the most unhappy are those who
are impelled by temperament to mingle social propaganda
with their artistic work. Rutland Boughton has the soul
<a name="png.260" id="png.260" href="#png.260"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the artist-preacher. He has persuaded me to many
things: he almost persuaded me to “try” vegetarianism,
and I remember one morning very well when, sitting on
the end of my bed, he pointed a finger at me and enumerated
all the evils that infallibly follow on the immoderate
drinking of whisky.</p>

<p>I regret this tendency in him: it does not strengthen
his art, and it exhausts a good deal of his energy and time.
A practical mystic, a man of intense and sometimes
difficult moods, a man so honest himself that he is incapable
of suspecting dishonesty in others, a man who
is always poor, for he loves his art better than riches:
he is all these things. Now, a man who endures poverty
as cheerfully as he may, who is continually bashing his
head against the brick-wall indifference of others, and who
at the same time is extraordinarily sensitive, may seek
happiness, but, if he does, it will always elude him.
Boughton, of course, would deny this. I can hear him
saying: “But of course I’m happy!” At times,
Rutland, you are happy. You are happy when you are
immersed in a new composition, when you are playing
Beethoven (do you remember that evening when, on a
poorish piano, you played so bravely a couple of sonatas
for Edward Carpenter and me?), when you are lecturing,
when you have made a convert. But when you believe,
as you do, that the world is awry, has always been awry,
and shows every sign of continuing indefinitely to be
awry, how can you, with your ardour for rightness, for
justice, for goodness, be happy?</p>

<p>For years Boughton has done very special Festival work
at Glastonbury where, when the war has spent itself, I
hope to go for a week’s music, for at Glastonbury strange
things are being done—things that are destined, perhaps,
to divert in some measure the stream of our native music.</p>

<p>In the early days of August, 1914, Boughton burst
into my flat. I was still in civilian clothes and was
<a name="png.261" id="png.261" href="#png.261"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reading Ernest Dowson to discover how he stood the
war atmosphere: I thought he stood it very well.</p>

<p>“What, Gerald!” Boughton exclaimed; “not enlisted
yet?”</p>

<p>“My <em>dear</em> chap,” I protested, “I am old and married
and have a family. Besides, I don’t like killing people:
I’ve tried it. And I strongly object to being killed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can help without killing people. There’s
the A.S.C., for example.”</p>

<p>“A.S.C.? What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to enlist as a cook. Come along with me.”</p>

<p>But I told him that I was reading Dowson, that I was
presently going to read a volume of Æ, and after that I
had the fullest intention of strangling Debussy on the
piano.</p>

<p>So he went away to enlist as a cook. I heard, however,
that when he was told that, in addition to his duties as an
army cook, he might be called upon to slaughter animals,
he came away sad and dejected, and, I think, turned his
mind to other things.</p>

<p>Where he is now, I do not know. The war has blotted
most of us out, and few men know whether their best
friends are at the other end of the world or fighting in the
trenches in the very next sector on their right or left.</p>

<p>I have said somewhere that singers do not interest
me. Nor do they. But John Coates is something more
than a singer—superb artist, generous friend, unflagging
enthusiast, maker of reputations. He is at once a grown-up
boy full of high spirits and a profound mystic. There
are many men who have seen him on the stage in some
light opera who have never guessed that his buoyant
spirits are the outcome of a soul that is content with its
own destiny. To me, his interpretation of Elgar’s
<cite>Gerontius</cite> is one of the great things of modern times—as
great as Ackté’s <cite>Salome</cite>, as great as Kreisler’s
<a name="png.262" id="png.262" href="#png.262"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>violin-playing, as wonderful as the genius of Augustus John.
“Honest John Coates!” is his title: I have heard him
so described many times in London and the provinces.
A man you can trust with anything: a very fine and noble
gentleman, humble yet proud.</p>

<p>His reverence for Elgar is extraordinary. I have been
told that, on one occasion, after being in the company
of the distinguished composer for an hour or so, he joined
a few friends who were sitting in another room.</p>

<p>“I have just been talking to the greatest man living,”
said he, with deep impressiveness and in the manner of one
who has been in the presence of someone holy.</p>

<p>I love such hero-worship. The man who can feel as
Coates does about Elgar is himself noble and not far
removed from greatness.</p>

<p>Cyril Scott possesses a mind of such exquisite refinement
that it can react only to the most delicate of appeals. He
is perhaps a little exotic, like his swaying and deliciously
scented <cite>Lotus Flower</cite>. Many years ago I was introduced
to his music, and in pre-war days I very rarely let a week
go by without playing something of his. On only one
occasion was I thrown into his company, and even then I
was not aware of the identity of the somewhat excited and,
to me, extraordinarily interesting man who sat restlessly
in his chair and spoke a little vehemently. He struck me
as a man easily carried away by his ideals, carried away
into a world where logic is useless and facts are worse
than dust.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter XXII: People I Would Like to Meet"><a name="png.263" id="png.263" href="#png.263"><span class="pagenum"><span

 /></span></span></a>CHAPTER XXII<br
 />PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO MEET</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I suppose</span> that even the most outrageously sincere
of men are to some extent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseurs</i>, if not to themselves,
then to other people. The artistic temperament
must either attitudinise or die. Posturing is the
most delicate, the most dangerous, of all the arts. To
pose before others is risky, but to pose before oneself is
most hazardous, for no one in the world is so easy to
deceive, and so ready to be deceived, as oneself, and to be
deluded by a fancy picture that one has drawn and painted
in hectic moments is to appear to the world as a fantastic
clown.</p>

<p>Deluded thus, it appears to me, is W. B. Yeats. He is,
of course, a fine though not a great poet: no reasonable
man can question that. And there are lines and verses
of his that have become woven into the very texture of
my mind. Moreover, I recognise that it is futile to quarrel
with a man because he is not other than he is. Yet I
do quarrel with him. I remember a photograph of Yeats,
a photograph I have not seen for ten or twelve years,
wherein he appears conscious of nothing in the world but
himself, conscious of nothing but his hair, his eyes, his
hands—especially his hands. His fingers are so long
that one is surprised that, his palm resting on his knee,
they do not reach to the floor. It is, I concede, a human
weakness for a man whom Nature has gifted (or do I mean
cursed?) with the appearance of a poet, to play up to
Nature and help her by delicate titivations. But to do
this successfully, one must have an overwhelming
<a name="png.264" id="png.264" href="#png.264"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>personality—a personality like that of Shelley, of Byron, of
Swinburne. It is a simple matter to look like a poet,
but to impose that look on mankind is given to few. It
is not given to W. B. Yeats.</p>

<p>How is it, I wonder, that one rather admires Æ for
believing in the objective existence of strange gods and
spirits, and yet despises Yeats for sharing this belief?
It is, I think, because one feels that Æ has a solid,
even massive, intellect controlling his fantasy, whereas
Yeats’ intellect is not distinguished either by subtlety or
massiveness. Yeats believes what he wishes to believe;
Æ believes only what he must. Yeats has an incurable
aching for the picturesque, and whilst he believes that he
is “helped” by the supernatural, I think that this help
is derived from his own imaginings, if indeed the question
of “help” comes in at all.</p>

<p>Why, then, should I wish to meet this man whom, it is
clear, I regard as self-deluded and for whom my respect
is mingled with a feeling that is not very far removed from
dislike? Really, I do not know. His attitude of mind
is not uncommon, and I have met many men and women
his equal in intellectual force. I think that perhaps I
wish to study at first hand a mind that is so exquisite in
its refinement, so sensitive in its moods, so invariably right
in its choice of words. From all the tens of thousands of
words that exist, how difficult it is to select the one word
that is inevitable! And how slender and fragile a man’s
work becomes when his mind must perforce invariably
pounce upon the one only word! The great writers were
not so fastidious. Scott, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Balzac
and a hundred others: take, if you wish, any half-dozen
words from almost any page of their writings and substitute
six others, and what will be lost thereby? Scott and
Byron and Balzac, and even Shelley and Keats, have, I
think, not more than a hundred or so pages that could
not with safety be tampered with in this manner.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>There is something lily-fingered and, to me, something
disagreeable and effeminate in a writer who, at all times
and seasons, searches and burrows for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot juste</i>. I
am curious about such writers, curious though I know
instinctively that they love letters more than they love
life. To me such men are incomprehensible, and in them,
somewhere, something is wrong. Men who do not feel
lust for life have thin necks, or shallow pates, or neurasthenia....
Perhaps, after all, I am something of a
student of nerve trouble, and wish to meet Yeats in order
to satisfy myself what precisely is lacking in him.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>It is a popular fallacy that versatility is invariably
accompanied by shallowness, whereas, of course, almost
all men of great genius have been peculiarly and even
marvellously versatile. For me, versatility has most
powerful attraction. The man with only one talent is
as uninteresting as the man with no talent at all. Perhaps
Hilaire Belloc has retained his hold on me because he is
continually surprising me. He has done so many different
and opposed things so admirably, that it seems impossible
he should strike out in yet another line; but I know very
well that before twelve months have gone he will have
turned his amazing powers in still another direction, and
will accomplish his task better than any other living man
can do it.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years have gone since early one spring
I walked alone across Devon from Ilfracombe to Exeter
and from Exeter to Land’s End. Now, I went alone
simply because Belloc had walked alone across much of
France and Italy, and the spirit of imitation was then,
as it is now, very strong within me. I had just read his
glorious <cite>Path to Rome</cite>, and I carried a copy of the first
edition in my haversack, reading it by the wayside and
forgetting my loneliness (for I was many times pathetically
lonely) in Belloc’s most excellent company. I pondered
<a name="png.266" id="png.266" href="#png.266"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>over the nature of this man for many hours, envying him,
and thinking that a man with such great and diverse
gifts must be reckoned among the happiest people alive.
I remember that during the weeks I walked in Devon and
Cornwall I copied him as far as I could in the most minute
particular, and at Clovelly, one golden evening as I stood
talking with some tall, Spanish-looking fishermen, I
suddenly made up my mind that I would write to him. I
do not know what I wrote, but a couple of days later a
reply came from him telling me that my letter had given
him more pleasure than any of the enthusiastic reviews
in the papers. This letter I pasted in my copy of <cite>The
Path to Rome</cite>, and in 1915 a friend begged me to allow him
to take it with him to France. He had a copy of his own,
but he wished to take mine. That friend (our worship
of Belloc was one of the many things we had in common)
now lies dead, and I like to think that his comrades buried
my precious book with him.</p>

<p>My imitation of, and devotion to, Belloc led me into
several amusing scrapes, and I recollect arriving ruefully
at Helston one wet afternoon and seeking shelter at an
inn called, I think, The Angel. Having arranged to
proceed to Penzance by train early in the evening, I went
to bed whilst they dried my clothes. Whilst in bed, I
recalled that Belloc had often praised Beaune and that I
had never tasted it. So I ordered a bottle, drank it at
about 4 <span class="allsc">P.M.</span>—and promptly went to sleep for twelve
hours!</p>

<p>Even now, on the borderland of middle age, I cannot
pick up a new book of Belloc’s without a little thrill:
he is so clean, so bravely prejudiced, so courageous. He
is a lover of wine and beer, of literature, of the Sussex
downs, of the great small things of life: a mystic, a man
of affairs, a poet. What, indeed, is he not that is fine and
noble and free?</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In the musical world one is accustomed to infant
prodigies; very rarely do they develop their powers.
But in the literary world infant prodigies are rare, and
at the moment I can recall among writers of the past the
boy Chatterton and that not quite so remarkable but,
nevertheless, very distinguished youth, Oliver Madox
Brown. In our own days we have had two or three men
of letters whose first work, written in their late teens or
early twenties, promised more, I think, than their later
books have fulfilled. I am thinking more particularly
of Edwin Pugh and William Romaine Paterson, the latter
of whom usually writes under the pseudonym of “Benjamin
Swift.”</p>

<p>Many of us must remember Benjamin Swift’s <cite>Nancy
Noon</cite>, a strange novel that jerked the literary world into
excitement two decades ago. The writer of it was but
a boy, and though a few critics declared that he “derived”
from Meredith, it was almost universally acknowledged
that, for sheer originality both in style and in its general
outlook upon the world, the novel was head and shoulders
above any contemporary literature. So we all kept a
close watch upon Benjamin Swift, reading each fresh work
(and there were many fresh works, for the new-comer was
very productive) with an eager anticipation which, alas!
was foiled again and again. I remember six or eight of
his books, each lit with genius, but all a little crude and
violent and not one of them indicating that the writer’s
mind was becoming more mature. It was a vigorous,
eruptive mind with which one was in contact, but it was
also a mind in such incessant turmoil that one searched
in vain in each of its products for that “point of rest”
which Coventry Patmore maintains is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of
all fine works of art.</p>

<p>In some way that I forget Benjamin Swift and I got
into correspondence, and I still possess a bundle of his
letters, mostly about his work. I remember that in one
<a name="png.268" id="png.268" href="#png.268"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of my letters I ventured to indicate what I thought were
some of his faults: I called in question his knowledge of
music, I expressed disapproval of his violence, and I told
him I feared that he was in danger of settling down to
being a mere “eccentric” writer. My letter, as might
have been expected, produced no effect, and though I
have not read his latest works (in dug-outs and trenches
one reads everything that comes to hand, but Benjamin
Swift has to be sought), I am given to understand that
they are in many ways like his first efforts—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, violent,
eruptive, yet distinguished and glowing here and there
with a genius that is always hectic.</p>

<p>Years ago, Swift invited me to call on him whenever I
should happen to be in town, and though I should very
much like to meet him, I have never accepted his invitation.
One is like that. One shrinks from satisfying one’s
curiosity. I picture Benjamin Swift as bearing a resemblance
to Strindberg, but in my mind’s eye his lips are
thinner and straighter than Strindberg’s, and his eyes
are more vehement.</p>

<p>What is it, I wonder, that prevents this writer from
ranking among the great? His intellect is wide and
deep enough, his literary talent is very considerable, and
his experience of life has been exceptionally varied.
There is a twist in his genius, a maggot in his brain. He
sees life grotesquely; some of the people he creates are
like the men and women one meets in nightmares.</p>

<p>Sometimes I amuse myself by inventing conversations
between people opposed in temperament—<i>e.g.</i> Sir Owen
Seaman and Mr Hall Caine, Mr John Galsworthy and
“Marmaduke,” Little Tich and Lord Morley, and I often
wish a brain much brighter than my own (Mr Max
Beerbohm’s, for example) would occupy its idle hours in
writing a book of such conversations. I commend the
idea to Mr E. V. Lucas, also, and to Messrs A. A.<!-- TN: original reads "A. M." --> Milne
<a name="png.269" id="png.269" href="#png.269"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and Bernard Shaw (only Shaw’s fun is apt to be so
distressingly emphatic and double-fisted).</p>

<p>Among the dead, I make Sir Richard Burton meet and
talk with Herbert Spencer, and I always call this conversation
<cite>The Man and the Mummy</cite>. It is strange, but
we have not, so far as I am aware, any record of Burton’s
rich and provocative conversation, though I have been
assured by men who knew him well that his talk was the
best they had heard. Sir Richard Burton is one of the
men whom I most wish to meet, and perhaps when my
happy sojourn on this planet comes to a close, I shall
be allowed to serve him in some humble capacity. To
me he has always seemed to belong to Elizabethan times,
and I think that he must often have cursed at Fate for
placing him in the middle of a century that could not fully
understand or appreciate him.</p>

<p>In our own days we have many young men of a spirit
akin to that of Burton, though not one of them may
possess a tithe of his genius or of his colossal intellect.
I refer, of course, to our numerous soldier-poets—gallant
young men of thought and action, of quick and generous
sympathy, of noble aspiration. Most of you who read
what I am now writing must know at least one man
belonging to this type, for there are hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of them—men who, but for the war, would
probably never have written a line of poetry, but whose
souls have been stirred and whose hearts have been fired
by the grandest emotion that can urge mankind to self-sacrifice:
I mean the never-dying emotion of patriotism—that
emotion at which the sexless sneer, which the
“cosmopolitan” regards with amusement, and for which
men of imagination and grit gladly die.</p>

<p>One soldier of this type I knew intimately, and I would
gladly know many of those others who have thrilled us
with their poems. Let me describe my friend to you.
He is no longer young: his precise age is thirty-five: but
<a name="png.270" id="png.270" href="#png.270"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he was among those who, early in August, 1914, after
first putting his small affairs in order, enlisted in Lord
Kitchener’s Army. He made no fuss about it, and told
none but his most intimate friends what he had done.
I met him a few months after he had joined up; he was
then a Corporal, and seemed to me the happiest man I
had met for many a day. He told me that he had begun
to write “seriously,” for hitherto his scribbling had been
of a cursory and trivial nature. But he showed me none
of his work, and it was not until he had been in France
some little time that his verses began to appear in one or
two reviews. Having been granted a commission, he
quickly rose to the rank of Captain. He was mentioned
in dispatches twice and, having led a particularly successful
bombing raid on the enemy’s trenches, was awarded the
Military Cross.</p>

<p>There is, I know, nothing very unusual in this bare record
as I have set it down; the unusual, indeed extraordinary,
nature of this case is that before the war my friend had
been a reserved, unadventurous but very capable bank
clerk, quite undistinguished and apparently without
ambition. But hidden fires must from his youth have
been smouldering in his heart, and it required the war’s
disturbance and excitement to blow these ashes into
flame, and the war’s opportunity was needed to disclose
of what fine material he was made. I flatter myself that
I had always known his nature was fine and distinguished,
for though he was a bank clerk one would never have
guessed it from his conversation and demeanour. I also
know that, generations ago, his forbears played a by-no-means
ignoble part in our country’s history, and for that
reason alone I felt that, though concealed, there were
imagination and aspiration abiding in his soul.</p>

<p>One of my friends, Anna Wickham, knows D. H.
Lawrence very well, and one day I asked her if she
<a name="png.271" id="png.271" href="#png.271"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>271<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>would arrange for me to meet him at her house. But she
brushed aside the suggestion with the few words that she
was not particularly interested in Lawrence and that my
time might be wasted if spent with him. Such a suggestion
amazed, and still amazes me, and I cannot but think
that Anna Wickham had never troubled to read any of
D. H. Lawrence’s writings, for it often happens among
literary people that close friends do not look at each other’s
work.</p>

<p>To me D. H. Lawrence is perhaps the most peculiarly
original English writer living. In his poems he is so
egoistic as almost to seem like an egomaniac, and in two
or three of his novels he is obsessed and overwhelmed by
the passion of sex. Yet in <cite>Sons and Lovers</cite>, and in that
wonderful first book of his called, I think, <cite>The Red Peacock</cite>,
he gets clean away from himself, and is as objective as all
great creative artists are and should be. Every writer
must, of course, portray life in terms of himself, but only
small men continually thrust themselves and themselves
only on to an embarrassed public. But Lawrence has an
insatiable curiosity about himself, and it seems at times
as though he is not anxious to discover or uncover life,
but to penetrate to the deeps of his own nature and shout
out at the top of his voice what he has found there. In
such egoism, there is, of course, strength as well as weakness,
and the very fault, so grave and so calamitous, that
bars him from achieving great work is, nevertheless, an
attraction to those who are much intrigued by psychology.</p>

<p>There are, are there not? two kinds of imaginative
literature: the kind we read without more than a passing
thought for the man or woman who has written it; and
the kind we read primarily because we are enormously
interested in the personality and temperament of the man
or woman from whom that literature comes. In removing
himself to Italy instead of throwing himself heart and soul
into the ugly but extraordinary life that these years are
<a name="png.272" id="png.272" href="#png.272"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>giving us, D. H. Lawrence is, I believe, evading his destiny
and is thereby weakening the gifts and tampering with
the intellect of a man whose name should stand near the
head of all contemporary writers.</p>

<p>If Mr Lawrence should by chance read these pages, he
will acquit me of impertinence if he remembers that he
has taken the public into his confidence, and that he must
expect the public to make some comment upon what he,
uninvited, has told us.</p>

if not altogether impossible, to regard me as a
guileless youth. Yet I ask you so to regard me.
For, if I be not guileless, how can one explain the whole-hearted
enjoyment I used to derive from my occasional
visits to the Crab Tree Club in Soho, and the Cabaret Club
in Heddon Street during the twelve months before the
war?</p>

<p>I had been a considerable time in London before it
occurred to me that there was any other way of spending
the night except in bed. Evenings, of course, were spent
either at home, the theatre, the Café Royal, a concert
hall, a music hall, or at friends’ flats and studios, and
though it is true that sometimes friends induced you
to stay, or you induced friends to stay, until dawn,
yet these long hours were never deliberately planned
beforehand.</p>

<p>But I had the Café Royal habit, and the Café Royal, in
a sort of way, used to be an ante-chamber to various
night clubs. At midnight, or shortly after, when I left
the Café with my friends, I used to find that, instead of
proceeding to their respective homes, they went to one
place or another where you made revelry and talked
nonsense and, perchance, drank what proved at eight
o’clock next morning to have been a little more than was
good for you.</p>

<p>“Come with us to the Crab Tree,” said two or three
friends on one of these occasions.</p>

<p><a name="png.274" id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>And go I did. It was my very first visit to a night club,
and I expected to find I know not what scenes of dissipation
and naughtiness. I imagined that I should meet
women even more strange than some of the strange women
of the Café Royal, that I should behold dresses so daring
that they could no longer be called dresses at all, that the
music would be ravishing, the conversation sparkling,
the men distinguished, the food delicate beyond words,
the wine of a perfect bouquet. Instead, after walking
up a flight of stairs, I found a large bare room with five
men in it, one of them being the bar-tender who, behind
rows of bottles of whisky and stout, was polishing glasses.
Of the other men, three were members who had just
arrived, and the fourth was the pianist who, later on, was
to play rag-time for the dancers.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment on the threshold of this empty
room, feeling rather exasperated that I had come
hither.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said one of my friends, a little pugnacious
Scotsman with a nose and chin like Wagner’s;
“wait a bit. Things will soon brighten up.”</p>

<p>So we stepped to the bar and engaged the pianist in
conversation. He was something of a scholar and had
made a study of rag-time from the historical point of view.
He played me two or three examples of rag-time which he
declared occurred in Bach, and I accepted his word,
though I looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>The note of that night was youth. There was no hectic
excitement, no Bacchic frenzy: everybody was jolly
glad to be alive. Somebody has defined happiness as
conscious pleasure. If that definition holds good, then I
was happy that night, for I remember saying to myself:
“I am coming here again.” I loved the feeling of life the
place gave me; the exhilaration of it seemed to pierce
into my marrow. I did not want to talk to anybody.
I merely wanted to sit back and watch everything: the
<a name="png.275" id="png.275" href="#png.275"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>furtive smiles of half-shy women who, happy in the arms
of those they loved, were afraid to reveal too much of
their happiness; the most delicate ankles of a slim girl
I knew, but whose name (was it Kitty or Mimi?) I only
half remembered; the kaleidoscope of colour on the
platform where the dancers were. The women were like
flowers—orchids suddenly endowed with movement.... I
compared the scene with the spectacle afforded me by
Murray’s Club a few nights previously, when Ivan Heald
and I were taken there for an hour or two. Some ladies
at Murray’s had had green hair, but only a poet like
Baudelaire can wear green hair with success. But at
Murray’s the people were all old. Young girls of twenty
were old. Everybody was old except the aged, and they
pranced and frisked to prove their unconquerable youth....
But at this jolly Crab Tree youth was in the air,
in the music, in the laughter.</p>

<p>And, feeling a little intoxicated with happiness, I
allowed a gentle melancholy to steal over me, as one
sometimes does in certain moods. I thought of Paris,
for this scene reminded me of Paris: I was full of longing
for Paris, and I remembered how in the spring of 1912
I used to sit in an attic in the Quartier Latin wondering
and wondering. By that curious power that the mind,
when a little excited, seems to possess—I mean the power
of transferring one from a scene where one is happy to a
scene where one would be still happier—I saw myself
aimlessly strolling beneath the plane-trees on the banks
of the Seine. I took out a pencil and wrote:</p>

<p>These verses (though you would hardly think so) cost
me infinite trouble, and when I had finished them I looked
up from my scrawl and saw that the room was half-empty.</p>

<p>“Is it so late then?” I asked a man sitting next to me.
I saw it was Aleister Crowley, and he looked at me rather
balefully.</p>

<p>“No: so early. Six o’clock, to be precise.”</p>

<p>And he turned his back on me and gazed at a wall on
which no pictures hung.</p>

<p>So I picked up my straw hat and tried to find my
Scots friend. He was sitting behind the piano, talking
very earnestly to a man I did not know.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nicol Bain,” said I, “I <em>am</em> so hungry.”</p>

<p>The streets were strewn with sunshine, and Bain took
off his hat and looked long and long at the blue sky.</p>

<p>“How damned fine to be alive!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“How long have you been alive?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Only since I came to London.”</p>

<p>“I was alive for three years in Manchester, but during
all those years I sat at a desk pretending to be a clerk,
<a name="png.277" id="png.277" href="#png.277"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I was dead, quite dead. So, you see, we really <em>are</em> young.
You are about five, and I am nearly seven.”</p>

<p>He steered me into a restaurant which appeared to
cater specially for night-birds, and Bain ate bacon and
eggs, whilst I feasted on a dish of strawberries, brown bread
and coffee.</p>

<p>“I would,” said I, “much prefer to have bacon and
eggs, but strawberries seem to be more in the picture,
don’t you think? I am sure I am behaving very nobly
to fit into the picture at the expense of my yearning inside....
And now, where can we get a bath?”</p>

<p>After that first visit I went frequently to the Crab
Tree Club. There I met many poets and journalists and
artists, and there, one night, a poet—a great strapping
fellow, all bone and sinew and muscle—loudly challenged
me to fight him. He is a man of some genius, well known
both here and in America. The exact cause of his quarrel
with me I have forgotten, but it appeared that, unwittingly,
I had done him some real injury—or he thought I
had. He spoke heatedly to me and I replied still more
heatedly. Suddenly, he rose, faced me menacingly, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“All right, then. Come and fight it out. Come and
fight it out downstairs.”</p>

<p>He looked at me with loathing.</p>

<p>I must have paled, I think, for I know that his terrific
anger was like an onslaught. But I realised that I must
accept his challenge. I hated the thought of what was
before me, and hoped it would soon be over.</p>

<p>“Very good. We’ll go downstairs.”</p>

<p>I felt a hand tighten approvingly on my arm and,
looking round, saw Ivan Heald. He came with me.</p>

<p>“Slog him, Gerald,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>But I felt most unheroic, and I know that as I made
my way to the door I was trembling a little.</p>

<p><a name="png.278" id="png.278" href="#png.278"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The whole room was interested now, and I realised
that we were going to have spectators. And then the
unexpected happened. The Club Secretary and a few
committee men rushed between us, dragging my sudden
enemy away. I was glad to be separated, for I was afraid
of him.... Is it possible that he was afraid of me?</p>

<p>Augustus John used to come sometimes, and I remember
chatting with P. G. Konody about Byzantine architecture,
about which I think I know something. But one did not
go to the Crab Tree for serious conversation. It was the
diversion of excitement we all <span class="nw">sought....</span></p>

<p>I think that for some weeks in the spring of 1914 I felt
like a character in a rather second-rate novel. Literally,
I was intoxicated with life. And so full of vitality did I
feel that I scarcely found time for sleep. I remember
walking with my wife from Soho to Battersea Park in
the early hours of a June or July morning after being up
all night. Several friends accompanied us, and though
we ought to have felt extremely jaded, we were as fresh
as paint at our seven o’clock breakfast of cherries and
coffee and honey. I tried to feel like George Meredith
as I ate, for I had read somewhere that he frequently
breakfasted on honey and coffee and fruit.... The
imitative instincts that we little artists have! How
strange it is! We can never be ourselves for long. We
are always imagining ourselves to be someone else more
distinguished, or more interesting. We are always
insatiably curious about the feelings and thoughts of
others. Pale imitators we are. And when we snatch
at our personalities, how feeble they seem ... how
feeble they are.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>One frightfully busy week an invitation came to us
from Madame Strindberg to sup with her at the Sign of
the Golden Calf, popularly known as The Cabaret. We
<a name="png.279" id="png.279" href="#png.279"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>did not particularly want to go, but I had been deeply
interested in August Strindberg ever since I had read Max
Nordau’s <cite>Degeneration</cite> (that, I think, is not the title,
but you know the book I mean) and I had wished to learn
more about this strange vitriolic personality, and since
Strindberg himself was dead, Madame Strindberg seemed
to be the best person to whom to go for information.</p>

<p>The Cabaret was in a large cellar at the end of Heddon
Street, and the narrow way was blocked up with taxis
as our own cab sped round the corner from Regent Street.
The place was nearly full, and a Frenchman with a little
waxed moustache was singing <cite>Two Eyes of Grey</cite>, with his
eyes glued to the ceiling in a stupidly sentimental
manner, and I recollect that our first impulse was to
turn and flee. One hears such songs, I am told, in
Bolton and Oldham, and, I dare say, in the London
suburbs, but that Madame Strindberg should come all
the way from Sweden and bring a man all the way
from France to sing the latest inanity was incredible.
But my eye caught some fantastically carved figures
that leered and leaned from the great, thick posts supporting
the roof. These painted creatures were attractive
and promising and futuristic, and:</p>

<p>“At all events, we’ll drink a bottle of champagne
before we go,” said I, as a waiter drew us to a table and
announced that supper was about to be served. “For
champagne always helps,” I added.</p>

<p>And, really, for an hour or two I required a little artificial
stimulus in order to survive the dullness of the musical
programme.</p>

<p>“Whoever the people are who run this place,” I said
to a pale, elderly man who sat opposite to me, “they are
extraordinarily stupid. They get Frank Harris to lecture
one evening and give us inane music the next. One doesn’t
come to a night club to be flapdoodled.”</p>

<p>“Flap——?” he queried.</p>

<p><a name="png.280" id="png.280" href="#png.280"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Flapdoodled. Yes. I mean these people who sing
and recite like a Penny Reading. They do these things
in Higher Wycombe and Bluzzerby-on-Stream. They
should not be done here.”</p>

<p>The pale man did not understand. He coughed behind
a very white hand and delicately selected a nut.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>And then Madame Strindberg approached our table.
She had been pointed out to me half-an-hour previously
and I had noted a pale little woman who appeared to
examine her guests rather nervously. She looked cold
and careworn. She was very silent, and her black
clothing and white face struck a sombre note in all the
moving light and colour of the large, warm room.</p>

<p>She came to the table and introduced herself to us,
sitting down and placing a nervous little hand in mine.
I soon discovered she had no conversation, for, try how
she might, she could not say anything that mattered in
the least. She chattered a little, made a few exclamations,
and then sat silent. To me she seemed full of negations,
denials. Personality she had, I daresay, but it did not
arouse my interest in the least, and after I had paid her
a few insincere compliments concerning the Club, I also
sat silent. After a while, she was taken away to another
table by some friends.</p>

<p>On subsequent occasions I saw her, but I do not remember
that I had further communication with her except
when I was made an honorary member of the Club, when
I wrote to her a short note of thanks. She was no key
to Strindberg: at all events, no key I could use.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>Later on that night, the room roused itself from its
semi-lethargy, and golden confetti and balls of coloured
paper were thrown about by ladies and gentlemen who,
not knowing each other, desired an acquaintanceship.
The balls of paper unrolled themselves into long ribbons
<a name="png.281" id="png.281" href="#png.281"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which, catching on to projections from the supporting
pillars, hung in long loops and festoons which, thickening,
soon began to resemble a gigantic spider’s web. Silly
musical toys were given us, and men and women—but
especially women—made silly noises on them and giggled,
or else shrieked uproariously.... Except for the supper,
which was excellent, the evening was not a success, and
I do not suppose I should have gone there again if I had
not been in search of Frank Harris, or if Jack Kahane
had not insisted upon my accompanying him.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>I made a fairly extensive examination of London night
clubs during the ensuing few months. One, near Blackfriars,
admitted me to full membership on the payment
of the sum of one shilling, and I used to go there—why,
I know not—and throw darts at a board and drink beer.
If I did not throw darts, I found I was deemed eccentric.
So I threw darts.</p>

<p>Murray’s was beyond my means, and I found the people
there untalented and plethoric. They ate too much.
And another club devoted to “the” profession was full
of trifling women and jaunty men. Actresses are dear
children, but at night they become tiresome. And actors
always want me to praise them. They always pretended
to be quite familiar with my name, and invariably invited
me to “have one.” Quite nice people, though, I assure
you.</p>

<div class="tb"><b>      .             .             .             .             .             .             .             .      </b></div>

<p>A night club is never for the old. Grey-haired people
should always be at home after midnight. And there
should be no card-playing. Dancing one would have
of course, and music of the finest. And wine, and many
pretty women, and a certain quietness, and invisible
waiters, and a perfume of roses.... As I write, I ask
myself: “Why should I not establish a night-club different
from all the others?” It would be so easy to be
<a name="png.282" id="png.282" href="#png.282"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>different; it would be so difficult for me not to be different....
One wants space, of course: I hate being crushed
against very full-bosomed ladies.... Oh, and above all,
I would have a big room set apart for the hour that comes
after dawn. Empty bottles, spilt wine, stale tobacco-smoke,
cigarette ends, all kinds of untidiness: how horrible
these are in the sun of a May or June morning! Yes,
we would all go at dawn into another room, a room
coloured green, with narcissi, and jonquils and hyacinths
on the tables: a room with open windows: a room with
fruit spread invitingly: a room where one could still be
gay and in which one need not feel sordid and spiritually
jaded and spiritually unclean.... If you have the right
mental outlook, you will never feel spiritually unclean
after a night of riot, but all our London night clubs in
pre-war days seemed to conspire together to make enjoyment
unhealthy, gaiety a matter for after-regret, and
exaltation a little disgraceful.... If someone will lend
me a lot of money (or give it me—why shouldn’t he?)
I will found a night club that will knock all the others
into a cocked <span class="nw">hat....</span></p>
